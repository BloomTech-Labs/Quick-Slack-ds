If y'all would like to read the rundown of my success over the past few months:
- Graduated with CS4 in April 2018.
- Using Built in Colorado, Built in Austin, LinkedIn, and Lambda Job Boards I applied to 113 Jobs, Received 2 Coding interviews, which led to no offers.
- Since being jobless for 7 months during Lambda School, and unable to land something within the first 45 Days of graduation, I was forced to move with family in Rapid City, SD.
- Printed off 10 copies of my resume and walked into every dev shop, marketing agency, and software related company. Out of the 10 resumes I handed off, 6 Companies called for interviews, 3 Offers.
- On June 25th I accepted a .NET C# Software Engineer Role at Projex.
- I worked the Projex job solely for experience, being paid less than $20 an hour. It was hell, but I picked up C# in that time!
- Through Lambda School and a connection through <@U9E7020TX>, I was able to land an interview with Cognizant in September.
- Friday 10/19/2018, I was offered the position at Cognizant. I will be working with .NET C#.

2 Key things I learned from this experience:
1. Walking into a business with resume in hand works! I had better stats vs online applications.
2. Take what you can get to get your foot in the door. Had I had not taken the Projex Job, I would not have had the experience required to land my new role!

Big Shout out to <@U4KHSNE3D> for seeing my potential and giving me a shot, <@U8AQK7C3X> for all the career coaching advice which helped me land more Salary $$$$, <@U9E7020TX> for the many leads, contract, and advice. Lastly, of course none of it would have been possible without the entire Lambda School Faculty.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

195,1653,"I have a suggestion about the salary sharing / not sharing thing that might end the constant drama. So Buffer - the social media content company - has a publicly available spreadsheet with every single empoyee’s name, position, and salary. Can Lambda do the same thing but with the following differences - No names, instead the columns should be the Job Title, Company, Salary, Location, and the whole spreadsheet should be grouped by Cohort. So let’s say iOS2, you’ve got three entries like Mid Level iOS Developer at Nexient, $125,000 in San Francisco. Under CS14, you’ve got Junior Web Developer at Google, for $75,000 in New York, and everyone in Lambda can access the spreadsheet, but it doesn’t include anyone’s names. The point I think <@UEPTY5B8B> was trying to get at is that salary data IS very important, and the key difference between salaries on Glassdoor, is that anyone can submit a salary to Glassdoor and there’s no way to know if it’s true. Whereas, if Lambda puts actual verified offers into a nameless spreadsheet, people can depend on that information as reliable. Just an idea. While I’m sure everyone is always super thrilled for everyone who gets an offer, I think it’s disingenuous to pretend that majority of people here are not motivated at least on some level by achieving a certain salary level and changing their lives for the better. That’s why the data matters, and I understand people’s reluctance to associate their name or face with it, hence the nameless spreadsheet.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

207,1753,"Hello Lambdainas!

I just signed a contract for my first full time job a a Software Engineer.
A little of context of my journey through Lambda and how I landed the school.

```
I guess I'm the first Lambda student from Spain.

I changed two degree courses before Lambda School, an Engineering and an Economics degree. Those are beautiful studies, I learned a lot in all those years of study and I owe them a lot of what I am now.

I treated programming and coding as a tool to perform better in my life and career, but then I realised that It wasn't a tool but my passion. Immediately I made a radical change in my current studies and job I had at that time, 2014, with the aim to be a software engineer in a mid-term.

Whilst struggling working full time as a freelance, I started building and improving my Developer skills with self-passed courses, that really helped me. But then I realised that in order to accelerate my learning path it was worth attending a school, a proper and good school. A school with a Computer Science curriculum was my objective.

I'm not young and not old, I'm at the time I write this comment 37 years old. I would love to attend a university and do Computer Science studies, but that was not an option, it would require many years of studies, with my current age and family responsibilities that path was not realistic, the goal was to start working as a software engineer in a short-term. What to do? Look for a ""boot camp""-like school with a strong focus on Computer Science which teach modern market-technologies.

In my research, Lambda was the sole school that met my requirements: Computer Science curriculum, modern technologies and a modern school in contact and exposed to the top digital communities. It looked so great that I thought it was not real or unreachable.

In order to be able to attend Lambda School, taking the best of the curriculum doing nothing but just studying, I had to take a big-huge loan to allow me to cover all my family and living expenses in all the 6-months of the curriculum and a couple of job-search-months.

It was a scary and big life-bet I took. I had to be able to have a better job after Lambda or I would have serious problems paying the loan.

IT WAS WORTH IT! I landed a new universe of job possibilities and career growth, much better than the one I imagined when I started Lambda.

Here I am, graduated from Lambda, starting my new dreamed career working in what is my passion.

282,2462,"<!channel> - Attention Lambda Students. After a lengthy wait our first CIRR report has just been published, you can check it out at <https://cirr.org/data>. Many students have been asking for this, and we’re very excited about this milestone. Our 180 day placement rate during this reporting window is 85.9%. We think this is a pretty good start, but we’re nowhere near satisfied with those results.

Our North Star at Lambda School is the outcomes of you, our students. We want you to have a great experience while applying, studying, and working on projects here, but more than anything else, we want you to get a good job when you leave. On the surface, that result looks pretty binary, and I'm sure if we surveyed students on their first day of class, and asked you to describe your ideal outcome at the end of the program, most of you would say something like ""I'd like to be working full time, paid a competitive wage, using the skills I learned at Lambda School.""

This is the only outcome that we count as a win. This is why we've structured our ISAs to include things like a minimum income. Nobody wins unless we all win.

When we first joined CIRR, I didn’t have much insight about their standards or process for reporting data. I’d like to share a few things I’ve learned over the last few months while working with them.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

To <@U781DGLD6> &amp; <@U8VH1M7PV>, my 2 PMs that always encouraged me and listened to my ramblings, <@U9YJY0474> &amp; <@U9M2EJ9UL> who started in the same PM group as I did, worked with me as PMs for CS12 and eventually made our labs project what it became (alongside the rest of the team <@U9VCU8DD0> &amp; <@U9WDY4B5Y> Honda of course)!
The rest of the PM team of CS12, and all of the students who were patient with us and put in a crazy amount of work.
To <@U921SQD7U> and <@UAH44F6EA> for always being understanding and a great time.
<@U9RB8C4LT> &amp; <@U9J4GRFHB> for being around at the craziest times and simply being awesome!
And last but not least, to everyone else I did not mention! I've met nothing but excellent people here and am thrilled to see what is coming our way!","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

331,2928,"I joined the Lambda slack months before I actually started my cohort (WEB14) and I’ve just been over here pining for the day I’d get to post in this channel... and it’s here! I’ve accepted the perfect job for me - I’ll be the third Web Dev at a nonprofit data science shop working to improve education and career outcomes in K-12 education. 

Applying what I learned at Lambda to a social justice mission that is so dear to my heart (I’m the daughter of a teacher, and there’s a reason I wanted to devote my small amount of free time to being a PT PM) is exactly what I always planned to do, but I didn’t think I’d be so lucky as to get paid to do it so quickly! 

<@U8QE15GJJ>, you might not remember but I demoed to the cohort during UI project week and I was waaaaaaay at the end of the list and when I said “I did what everyone else did,” you called me out on devaluing my work and I can’t thank you enough. I was struggling to feel like I belonged here, and that was the first spark of confidence in what I can make that just got me a job in a language and framework I’ve never touched before. I’ll be blasting banjo music in my car on my first day. 

Cat included so y’all will recognize me - I’m pretty sure she’s attended every lecture and about 90% of standytimes right there with me. (Also because she wouldn’t move.)","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

381,3542,"Today is my first day at work as an iOS Engineer. It’s still rather surreal, and I have to keep reminding myself how hard I worked for this, and to actually take a step back and enjoy the fact that it’s actually happening!!!

I’ve been camped in <#CB6GPKRPT|hired> since the beginning, cheering people on, and dreaming about the day my turn would come. I’m so happy to share that that day is today.

Two weeks ago, I accepted an amazing offer from Fundrise to join the company as a Software Engineer on their iOS team. I’m so incredibly thankful to everyone at Lambda who helped me on this journey, especially when I doubted myself and my abilities and skills.

Thank you so much firstly to <@U4KHSNE3D>, without whom this wouldn’t have been possible. Thank you to all of my instructors, especially <@UFA9S6H7U>, who never hesitated to get on Zoom and walk me through my difficulties. Thank you to @KarenZachary for taking a chance on me. Thank you immensely to <@UB3TRCFC3> who came through for me when things seemed impossible. Thank you <@UAH44F6EA> for being a voice of kindness. Thank you <@UDYBC7YGY> for calming me down when I decided to negotiate my offer and was having panic attacks thinking they’d rescind because I asked for too much (By the way, always negotiate, as terrifying as it was, I’m so glad I did, and I regret nothing).

Thank you to all my PMs, to my Labs group, and most especially to my Day One People :muscle::skin-tone-5:, my Ebeano :pikadance:, my iOS3 gang :ios3: - <@UCBNNL0R5>, <@UCE323TGC>, <@UD03ELVCP>, <@UCE9NAX41> and @SeanHendrix.

You guys were there for me every step of the way. Thank you for all the laughs, all the code, all the complaining, all the frustration, and support, and love. I simply would not have made it through Lambda iOS without you guys.

My offer was initially $100,000 base with $133,000 total, but I negotiated it to $110,000 base, $143,000 total.

I can’t believe this journey’s come to an end. I remember my first day at Lambda. I remember wondering if there would ever be a sprint challenge that wouldn’t end in tears.

I’m so happy, and I’m so glad I took the risk and made the plunge. Lambda School has been super worth it.

404,3834,"Hi everyone!
I am happy and excited to say that I have accepted  an offer from eBay!
I can not believe I have finally go to this point. It has been a great adventure these last 9 months and one that I will never forget.

Now for my shout outs:

<@U9GJJLJUD>, <@UBD669EKA>, and <@UBSFXJFEG>:
My favorite memory at Lambda school was working with all of you in Labs. I would not trade those 5 weeks for anything. I loved chatting on Discord about everything under the sun. You guys were so much fun and smart that I am glad that you were my first developer team.

PT3:
I miss you all so much! I loved being your Section Lead. You were such a bright and smart group and I know you will all go far! I hope you are all are having fun at Lambda still. I hope backend treated you kindly, that you are loving Labs, and the best of luck with CS. I know you all are unbelievably smart and that I will see you posting on here in no time.

<@UAH44F6EA> and <@U921SQD7U>:
Thank you so much for letting me be Section Lead. It was such a great experience and I was also happy that I got to talk to you too as well. You both are such hard workers and always brought a smile on my face!
(Also Patrick, have always loved your dad jokes!)

<@UECD1R9PU>:
I want to thank you so much for always answering my questions when I was a Section Lead. I would have been lost without you being there and having my back.

<@U9XPZT945>, <@U8ZJL80Q3>, <@UB24V3RCL>, <@U90UKAG21>:
Thank you all for being my PM! It was nice to always have you guys around to bug about questions and help me when I got super stuck.

<@UDBBPUL9M>, <@UCD3STB46>:
Thank you so much for all of the opportunities. Without you guys constantly giving me places to apply I would not have got such a cool offer. Thank you so much!

<@UDYBC7YGY>: You are my rock. I was so stressed out and every time I talked to you my mind would calm down. Thank you for all of the articles you sent me and all of the advice given.

Lastly, I want to say that this is an amazing school. I would be working at a restaurant job or having to take loans just to figure out where to go next for my career if not for this school. And this community is just the coolest. I have made some amazing friends here that I would have never met otherwise and now that I can not live without. This school has given me so much that I could not be more grateful. Thank you so much!

Now off to California for the next part of my story!","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

424,4121,"I'm beyond excited to share that I'm joining Newfront Insurance's Data Operations team in SF! My role is a hybrid of strategy, ops, &amp; engineering; I'll mostly be working on business process design, implementation, and automation. By way of background, Newfront is a Series B insurance tech startup that's hiring like wildfire (I've already started hinting that they should hire more Lambda grads). Check 'em out at <http://newfrontinsurance.com|newfrontinsurance.com>.

First, I'd like to thank all of the phenomenal instructors I've had here: <@U8QE15GJJ> <@UC043SA0G> <@U6UM1TFL3> <@U7J93733N> <@U61C720GN> <@UBZ7VJGH3>. Your excellent guidance has served not only myself, but many others students well, and I can't thank you enough. Just having the vocabulary and conceptual knowledge to even talk about programming and computer science with others has been incredible.

Next, thanks to my unwaveringly positive PMs: <@UAEENSCMA> <@UA9C3RWG2> &amp; <@UA49LN4DR>. All of you told me to trust the process and you were right. Thanks so much for giving me faith in the process and in my own abilities. Extra shouts for Tai for creating a bot named after me :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:

Enormous thanks as well to <@U9ECYGW1H> &amp; <@U9T8DGG82> for an incredible Labs experience. And it was a pleasure and an honor to build <http://getcadence.co|getcadence.co> during Labs9 with <@U9Q2F05FE> <@UC809MUG1> <@UC83A7BG8> &amp; <@UC5BBBH4J>!

A huge round of applause to <@UDYBC7YGY> for being my steadfast supporter and fielding all sorts of incessant questions during off-hours. PRO TIP: utilize your career coach; it can make all the difference in the world.

Shout-out to the whole Lambda team for taking a risk and building this institution. It was a pleasure to meet some of you in the office last week and I hope we'll cross paths in SF.

:bulb: Some quick tips for current students:

:twitter: Use Twitter! I got this opportunity off Twitter. The hiring manager and I actually spoke a bunch in Twitter DMs throughout the process. Twitter is a powerful professional tool. All you need to do is use it!

:book: Supplement your coursework. There's simply not enough time in lectures to learn everything there is to know. There might be cool things adjacent to the concepts you're learning that just don't get covered in lecture. So it's helpful to scaffold your knowledge with outside resources. I personally leaned on <http://javascript.info|javascript.info>, ""You Don't Know JS"", and the YouTube channel NetNinja a bunch.

:hammer_and_wrench: Build things. The more products / projects you can show off, the more seriously people will take you. I asked a lot of professional developers / product people for advice and this came up the most.

:books: Learn about adjacent areas to your own discipline. If you're a web dev, try learning some UX design or React Native! It shows people you're self-motivated and can extend your skills. I think I'm going to pick up some data science skills next!

Finally, if you have any questions about finding a role that combines business / engineering, feel free to DM me! (Just beware it might take me some time to respond) :slightly_smiling_face:","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

429,4204,"I remember looking into this channel seeing all of my fellow peers smiling and getting hired. I’m delighted that I finally get to post here as I’ve been hired by Accenture’s technology team.


Not only did I find this news out on my birthday a few weeks ago, the very same day, I found out that I’ll be expecting a little one! :baby::skin-tone-3: It was truly a surreal day.


Firstly, let me give a big thank you to just about everyone I’ve come in contact with here at Lambda. <@U8QE15GJJ> <@UC043SA0G> <@U6UM1TFL3> not only taught us how to be great developers, but how to learn and bring excitement to our learning. It’s an awesome community and the incentives for Lambda’s staff to ensure students are set-up for success are unmatched anywhere else.


:lobster: My PM group are true champions! it’s been quite the ride. Can’t wait to see y’all in here!

:web16: Web16 is an awesome cohort and I’ll never forget y’all!


Some things I’d echo that others have said in the past:
- Trust the process
- Start the job hunt early
- Don’t doubt yourself, you’ll be here soon enough!


Also — If you get the opportunity to be a PM, more specifically, a TA, take it. Being a TA further enhanced my skillset by helping me communicate better and teach others, and helped me land this job.


Best wishes to the everyone on their journey through Lambda. DM’s open if you need to chat about anything!

432,4281,"Well, its been a crazy ride. I am now FINALLY able to post in the hired channel!

I am now a Software Engineer, Web at Kapsch Trafficom! They are an AWESOME company that deals with all things tolling related! (Its actually a CRAZY business for tech! I was surprised when they showed me how much goes into this!)

After applying to over 1000+ jobs, having over 89 interviews, 40 of which went past the first interview, 23 of those that got to the last steps, and 3 offers later, I am now PROUD to have made it to the end of this long journey!

I say end, but its really just another beginning!

I want to thank <@U9GJJLJUD> <@U8Y1M9D1R> <@UBG4B7NBX> <@UAABJTW4U> who I have had the absolute PLEASURE to have gone through the ups and downs of the program with. Team Kepf rules!

<@U8QE15GJJ> for being an AMAZING instructor, an AMAZING mentor, and an AMAZING banjo player. You rock man, and Lambda is 300% better for having you here!
<@UC043SA0G> for the awesome time during React and Redux! You started with my cohort (iirc) and while it had a bumpy start, you ROCKED it and came out ontop man! Thank you so much for taking the time to break down problems and explain them to me. It helped me learn newer languages and frameworks after Lambda by using the same processes!

Special shout out to the CS instructors <@UBZ7VJGH3> <@U61C720GN> <@U7J93733N> - this is by far the hardest part of the program and there isnt any other instructors I would rather have teach it. You guys make amazing changes, teach amazingly in a precise and consistent manner that helps many including me digest and understand some of the hardest concepts in computer programming. You guys are awesome, and Beej, NEVER get rid of that space background :wink:

I also want to throw a special super heart felt thank you to my career coach, <@UDYBC7YGY> who has been my absolute rock through this process. When I was down and out she never stopped fighting in my corner. She stayed with me and kept up during that week we had 20 something interviews. An absolute godsend and amazing career coach <@U4KHSNE3D> give this lady a raise!

And then last but certainly not least <@U4KHSNE3D> thank you for reaching out to me in my times of need, and making sure that I know Lambda has my back. It can be easy to see Lambda as a business first, but even as CEO you take time out of your day to reach out and make sure everyone of your students in the program is taken care of and not taken advantage of. You are TRULY an amazing man, who has created what I believe to be the best system to help people in tough situations break their shackles and perpetuate their lives forward if they choose to make the jump. Thank you sir for all you have done.

To anyone who watches the hired channel and thinks of the day they too will be hired. Know it will not be easy, there will be bumps, there will be falls. But whats most important is that you get back up, wipe off the dust, and keep going. You can truly change your life if you put in the work. You all got this and I love you all! :heart:

434,4333,"I have been holding off on posting this. But it has finally happened. 11 months or so in and I am a Software Developer. It has been everything but easy. Being in CSPT2 has been rough. I was holding down a full time job and staying up until 2 am sometimes (CST) and waking up at 5:45. Fighting imposter syndrome on a regular basis and not believing I was really good enough. This offer letter is proof. I had to learn enough C# to write an application and understand the class and interface structure but I did it.  I am no imposter. Trust me when I say this, believe in yourself, stay committed and BE HUNGRY. Your time in this channel is coming.

One thing that really helped me was something <@U9E7020TX> said in one of our very first career presentations. ""GET GOOD AT TELLING YOUR STORY."" I was sitting in a bar and working on my Labs project and I was sitting next to three gentleman.  One of them leaned over and asked my what I was working on. Now maybe I talk to much, but I told them about labs and Lambda and some of the tech I was adding. Then they asked about me. To make a long story shorter I just told them ""My Story"" and how passionate I am about developing. turns out I was sitting next to the Lead Engineer, CEO and CTO of GuestX 3 miles from my house. They asked for my resume and a day I could come in for an interview. the rest is history.

O would like to thank <@U814BBRFW> for being a beast in teaching front-end and my study group. <@UBQCXTWBY> <@UB9MNG11N> <@UA7ACT7PT> <@UBMNZQW8Z> <@UAW0FMKTL> <@UBGGZ6J1G> <@U9Q99AH4N> If it wasnt for them I am sure I would have thrown in the towel. And <@UHFCF5UKS> for being the beast he is in prepping me before my interviews and coaching me through the whole process. This is unreal

441,4412,"I've waited until I could pull this little stunt to make my hired post - plenty of time for the shock to wear off but still fresh enough to be over the moon about it.

Just a little over one year ago, before I had heard of Lambda, I was a full time master's student, a 45hr/week employee making ~$27k/yr, a single parent sharing a 1br apartment with a preteen + big dog and cat, and struggling to understand how the ""work hard and make good grades"" path _still_ wasn't working for me at almost 30 and with a child who was now closer to adult than baby. There were nights when I would go to my 6p evening classes right after work ended (at 5:30 or later usually) with no idea how I would provide dinner after class ended at 8:30/9p. I remember one such time being grateful to the point of tears when students from a class before us had leftovers from a party and offered them to our class, and then having to act as though I wasn't desperately in need of the food or crushed when someone grabbed the only two sandwiches. I was working so hard and still falling so short.

One year ago the future I was holding out hope for was one that might include me making as much as $60-70k by the time I was at retirement age and having been frugal enough to actually retire, unlike some beloved family members. The idea of this future, though? Not even in the same stratosphere of thought. So I still sometimes break down crying when I'm reminded of what I'll be making before my 30th birthday this year, that I've got not only the resources to cover our needs _now_ but the long term skills to ensure I am not in a situation like that again (heaven forbid), and how much different and better life is from what it was one year ago.

I am so grateful to the instructors here, to the staff who work so hard to support us as students/employees and put out so many fires behind the scenes, to my peers who inspired me, challenged me, and have been so kind to me, and to <@U4KHSNE3D> (we all know why). I'm still amazed this is possible and am always looking for ways to tell people about it. Life changing opportunities like Lambda don't come around all that often. 

Btw, offer is $83.5k with a $3k relocation bonus. I just blacked it out bc I suspect it's going to end up on Twitter  :twitter: :wink:","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

I have a challenge for each and every one of us, staff included. Take a little bit of time this weekend to do some honest introspection. If you feel like your effort and grit have maybe slipped a little, if you feel like you've gotten a little too comfortable in your normal routine, or if you feel like you're not giving 100%, no matter the reason, I want to challenge you to come back after the holiday with renewed excitement and vigor. Dig deep and remember the reason you started this journey. Get passionate about changing your life. Get out of your comfort zone. This is go time! This won't come easy, but nothing worthwhile in life does. Let's do this! :muscle::lambda-red:

Over the weekend, let's post in this thread here what your goals and your personal commitments are going to be moving forward. :fire: :fire: :fire:","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

448,4503,"This is late. But better late than never, right? Last week I accepted a position at ChartIQ in Charlottesville, Virginia. I started on Thursday.

Lambda School has been a truly incredible experience. I am forever grateful to <@U4KHSNE3D> and the team working behind the scenes to make this experience possible. I would also like to thank my incredible instructors (<@U8QE15GJJ>, <@UC043SA0G>, <@U6UM1TFL3>, <@U7J93733N>, <@U61C720GN>, and <@UBZ7VJGH3>) and my labs team (<@UAE7DEAGJ>, <@U9Q2F05FE>, <@UC5BBBH4J>, and <@UC83A7BG8>). And while there are too many other to list here, a big thank you to all my fellow students who have helped make this experience what it was. Finally, a big shout out to <@UDYBC7YGY> for keeping me sane.

The hardest part about the job search for me was how arbitrary it feels. I made it to the final round at a number of companies that told me I was eminently qualified but did not extend an offer. All through Lambda if you do the work and the tests pass you advance to the next week. The job search reintroduces randomness to the equation, where you can ""pass"" but still fail for any number of reasons outside of your control. This can be incredibly discouraging. Try not to take it personally when this happens.

Finally, don't underestimate the power of networking. All of my interviews came through networking or through hiring partners. The local connections I made were especially likely to lead to at least a phone screen.

To all of you still still aiming at that job, keep up the hard work. You'll get there. Good luck!","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

463,4747,"I started Lambda school last May in the CS11 cohort. Let me start by saying this was no doubt the hardest and most rewarding thing I have attempted in my whole life. There were up times and down times. Times I felt on top of the world and other times I was on the verge of quitting. But I stuck with it, trusted the process, and rallied with my teammates, PMs, instructors, and support staff. I want to thank them all by name but there are too many to name. I do want to throw a special shout-out to <@U8QE15GJJ> <@U5SF97A1Z>  and <@U9E7020TX> who stepped up as more then just instructors but mentors, friends, and so much more. 

When I graduated in December I had set my wants and needs firm and jumped into applying and interviewing. I have applied for over 180 positions, interviewed at at least 70 of those, and received 3 offer letters. It did take me 5.5 months but I am excited to announce I am accepting the position of Jr Frontend Engineer at MX - a bank data aggregation and AI firm. My needs and wants were met and I couldn't be more excited about this opportunity. 

Lambda is life changing and you are all in the right place. Stick with it and stay positive!","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

467,4783,"I'm delighted to share that I've accepted a position as a Software Engineer at Elsevier in NYC!! :sparkles:

Of course, I wouldn't be here without all of the wonderful educators and innovators imagining and realizing Lambda School every day. I am infinitely grateful for each of you. I also endlessly appreciate my peers for their curiosity and constructive engagement with the school, rather than passive participation.

I started here immediately after finishing an expensive Bachelor's with little innate career potential. I was looking at a minimum of 3 years of grad school before job prospects would materialize. When I told people that instead of grad school, I was enrolling in an online school in an unrelated field, they were understandably skeptical. But back then, and now, it was clearly the most rational decision I've ever made.

Shout out to my friends forever in web14 &amp; to all of the wonderful webpt4 students I've had the joy of working with as a PM.

A UI Developer on one of my build week teams asked me what advice I had for students starting out which can be found here: <https://www.notion.so/lolasnotes/Lambda-Tips-7254ce040a29451c856881655a277d4f>

These are some of my interview prep notes: <https://www.notion.so/lolasnotes/d973eea66fbf4481847db934c9df6e6b?v=3e754b79af6d4438a3fadfa66177ddae>

And these are some of the questions + answers I was asked in actual interviews:

470,4869,"When I began the Full Stack Web Development course here at Lambda over a year ago in the CS11 cohort, my biggest concern wasn't so much that I wouldn't find a job, but that I wouldn't find a job within a reasonable commuting distance. I live in a rural area of southwest Michigan and as a single mom who promised my kids we would never move again, relocation is a luxury that is not an option for me.
I'm thrilled to announce that I've accepted a position as UI/UX Developer with Aunalytics in South Bend, IN. My salary is almost double what I made before Lambda and while I won't be earning as much as many other Lambda alumni who work in major metropolitan areas, I only have a 30-minute commute, so I don't have to relocate. And that's a perfect tradeoff for me.
While I'm being hired for one position, Aunalytics doesn't believe in ""boxing"" in employees to particular roles, so if I decide I want to code backend, they'll fully support my transition to backend. Or if I want to pursue data science, they support me while I learn and transition. This is an amazing company and I can't wait to join their team!
Thank you <@U4KHSNE3D> and everyone at Lambda School for renewing my hope and taking a chance on me. I hope I represent Lambda well. :awesome:","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

474,4931,"Since I was 11 years old, I knew what I wanted to do with my life. I still remember that fateful day when I was playing club penguin and I stumbled across the word HTML. I didn't know what it meant, but I knew that it was my destiny. I'm beyond excited to announce that my dream has finally become a reality - this week, I accepted a role as a full-stack software engineer at a small company in the bay area! This is definitely a huge step for me, especially considering that I'm 19 years old and that I've only worked one other job in my life as a cashier at walgreens. It took a lot of hard work and dedication to get here, but holy moly, did it all pay off! Choosing lambda instead of going to a university is definitely the best financial decision I've made so far. I'd like to give special thanks to my instructors - <@U8QE15GJJ> <@UC043SA0G> <@U6UM1TFL3>, you guys rock! I wouldn't be where I am today without lambda. I'd also like to give a shoutout to all my homies in web15 and web18, it was a pleasure learning with you all! For all those that are still on the job hunt, here is my advice: the number one thing is to believe in yourself and to be confident in your skills. Be honest if you don't know something, and ask a lot of questions! A positive mind will get you farther than you might expect. I can't even tell you how many rejection letters I received, but with persistence and patience, I was able to realize my dream. If a 19 year old with no degree and no professional experience can land a job as a software engineer, so can you. Rock on, my dudes :the_horns:","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

There is so much to be thankful for. So with that being said,

Thank you <@U8QE15GJJ>, <@U5SF97A1Z>, <@UC043SA0G>, <@U6UM1TFL3>, <@UBZ7VJGH3>, <@U61C720GN> and <@U7J93733N> for your fabulous instruction!

Thank you <@UF77V7NDU> for being my rock and always being there as me cheerleader!


Thank you to the most amazing friends I have made at Lambda for sticking by and laughing throughout all the good and bad moments.

Thank you, <@U921SQD7U>, for giving me the opportunity to PM

My journey at Lambda has been long - CS11 &gt; Next PM &gt; Labs11 &gt; Labs12 &amp; Labs 13 PM - but I wouldn't change a thing. I'd like to shout out to some of the people I've crossed paths with:

<@U6QPFSQTE> - Master of pep talks - you inspired me to give back and become a PM myself.  If you're on the fence, or unsure about PMing, definitely do it :lambda-pm:

<@U9RB8C4LT> <@U9J4GRFHB> - I'm lucky to consider you two of my closest friends here at Lambda :fire_engine:

<@UBC14ET7B> - I still can't believe two Lambdonians ended up in Medellin, Colombia. You are a BOS man :flag-co:

<@UCGF4E7CP> <@UAKHZ8SNA> <@UDLUVER6Z> <@UCQNGHBB7> - the BookMaps crew :blake-fieri:

<@UF5RJHFUJ> - you are the number one cheerleader :blob-wave:

<@UCD3STB46> it was a connection that you made that got me the connection that landed me this job, thank you :facepunch:

<@U4KHSNE3D> and the rest of the Lambda team, I am constantly amazed by the school you are building :lambda:

486,5108,"So stoked to be able to say I’ve accepted an offer for a Software Engineer position at Onshape! Like many of you, it’s been quite a long and tough journey getting to this point. It’s crazy to think that this all started because by chance, I followed <@U4KHSNE3D> on Twitter back in 2015 to watch the progress with his previous startup Grasswire. I saw that Austen and the team’s vision for education has massive potential and after bombarding his inbox with questions about Lambda, I was sold. The rest is history!

I strongly believe that the success of Lambda is due to the passion of faculty and quality of curriculum. Having said that, I wanted to thank a bunch of people that I've had the pleasure of learning from! Austen and Ben (<@U4LAUPCTY>) for this life changing thing you’ve created, <@U7J93733N> <@UBZ7VJGH3> and <@U61C720GN> for the solid CS fundamentals you taught us, <@UC043SA0G> <@U8QE15GJJ> and <@U6UM1TFL3> for carrying us through the world of full stack development, <@U9ECYGW1H> for the crucial Labs experience, <@U8Y945GCS> and <@U837QM9KM> for being amazing WEB PMs (how could I forget!) and a special shout out to <@UDYBC7YGY> and <@UDBBPUL9M> for being the most indispensible guides through the rollercoaster world of job hunting. Throughout the highs and lows, the imposter syndrome and struggling to stay confident, my career coach Kelsey is 100% the rock that got me to that finish line. The world would be a better place if every job hunter had a Kelsey by their side!

To everyone still in the thick of this process, never ever ever give up. Look at every day as a new opportunity to chip away at a weakness. When an interview goes poorly, pick yourself up and dig into what needs to change so the next one can be better. All it takes is one offer!

Below I’ve included the Anki flash card decks I put together for interview studying, I hope it helps! We’re all gonna make it :muscle:

489,5147,":wave: everyone!

I'm happy to announce that yesterday I accepted an offer for a Front-End Engineer position with Joymode in Los Angeles!

I started Lambda School with the web14 cohort in August of 2018 then moved through Labs 9 &amp; CS15. I've been a PM for webPT4 since November and am currently also a TA for CS17.

My favorite part of Lambda School is the community and I have to shout out a few of you I crossed paths with during my time here:

*web14*
<@UAEERGKR9>Thanks for inspiring &amp; giving me a taste of what it's like to contribute to open-source projects.
<@U9Q2F05FE>  Thank you for all the  incredibly helpful office hours.
<@U8V8PMV3K> Thank you for being an amazing PM who was always there to listen and push me to do more than what I thought was possible, shout out to Sumi's Squad!
<@U8QE15GJJ> I could not have chosen a better instructor to start my Lambda School experience with. You're an amazing teacher.
<@UC043SA0G> thanks for being a great instructor, helping me with a take-home project and all the extra work you do for the TA's.
<@U6UM1TFL3>  Great job of taking off the training wheels and prepping us for CS while being supportive and providing great instruction.

*Labs 9 Team flexlog*
<@UAA6EAWN9> - Amazing teammate. I learned a lot from watching you work with others and enjoyed programming and working together with you.
<@UAEGNMNA2> -  Thanks for all the good times and always being able to lift our team's spirits. I'm lucky to have been able to work with you.
<@U91074DCK> - It was great working with you not only on flexlog but pair programming through some of the tough CS assignments.  Thanks for always being available.
<@UCB3JEM1S> - Hey bro, I can't thank you enough. I have enjoyed working not only on flexlog with you but participating in the Zeit Hackathon with you  a few days before my on-site was incredibly empowering and I am so excited to see what you do in the future.
<@UA49LN4DR> -  Thanks keeping us on track and showing us what it would be like to be on a dev team.

*CS15*
<@UC5BBBH4J>, <@UC83A7BG8> &amp; <@UC2721RL0> - I learned a lot from each of you during the hours we spent pair-programming together :developers:
<@UAH9R7XBJ> - I was a bit worried when I moved into Flex for the C portion of the curriculum but from day 1 I knew I was in good hands after a few minutes of being in your GP. You have a great teaching style and I would not have applied to have been a TA myself had I not had such a great experience in your group.
<@U7J93733N> - Incredibly lucky to have learned from and worked with you. Your lectures were always engaging and filled with knowledge.
<@U61C720GN> -  Thank you for helping me be a better TA and always being available to answer my questions.
<@UBZ7VJGH3> -  Thanks for your all your time, positive energy and for always being available to answer my CS &amp; career questions.

*CS17 &amp; webPT4*
<@U95NN89ME> &amp; <@UCEGA17U5> -  Thanks for holding it down as supportive, helpful SL's and making my life easier when things got crazy.
All my PM/TA students -  Thanks for all your questions, support and good times. I look forward to seeing you succeed.

*Career Coaches &amp; Lambda Staff*
<@UDYBC7YGY> - You were incredibly supportive and helpful in prepping me for my interview &amp; on-site.
<@UF6SUAYAK> -  Thank you for helping me modernize my resume, style my portfolio &amp; prep for my interviews.
<@U4KHSNE3D> -  Thanks for everything. I'm so lucky to have found/followed you on Twitter. Applying to Lambda School has been one of the best decisions I've ever made. Your $500 tweet made the Joymode connection happen! :thankyoukindly::pray::skin-tone-2::bow:

&amp; many many more!

*TLDR*: I accepted an offer with Joymode :tada: , apply to be PM (you won't regret it!), :thankyoukindly: everybody!, &amp;  I :heart: Lambda!","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

491,5230,"I'm very excited to announce that I just accepted a job as a full stack Software Engineer at Gateway Apps here in Arkansas!! 

This was the first interview I had for a software job, and I never expected to actually land a job this quickly! I want to thank everybody here at Lambda for all of the great experience I've gained and am still gaining along the way.

Shout out to WebPT4 and <@UCDD6DMAS> for being the best PM I could ask for. 
I'm still not finished with the program yet, and am still planning on finishing out the full course while I continue working at my new job. 

The company mostly works with React.js with Graphql. I will be starting on a project turning a wordpress site with PHP into a React site for one of their biggest clients. 

I couldn't be more excited, proud and nervous all at the same time but I know I have the skills to push through and get it done thanks to Lambda!

To anyone struggling and wondering if it is worth it, I can tell you it is. I signed up for the part time track while working a 40+ hour job and just having a little daughter recently (will be 1 year in a few weeks!) So if I can pull it off, you can too!!!","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

492,5243,"I started my job as a consultant last week. I started the same day as 2 fresh CS grads who are very intelligent and each had done internships for almost a year. One worked with java and one worked with C#/.Net.

We are all going through training together before we are sent to a client. We have been going over general programming and CS topics over the first 8 days and working on a backend for a training project using C#/.Net. The syntax and strong typing of C# has been causing me some minor issues, but I have been told by the CS grads and the trainers that they are impressed at how well I have been able to keep up given that I don’t have a CS degree or any prior experience with C# or a similar language.

Then came today… We started working on the UI of the training project using just HTML and CSS so far. We were given mockups/wireframes to work from and we all started with building the sign in page. I was able to knock out the page in no time and witnessed the other 2 struggle a little bit and I was able to lend a hand and help them out. Then 2 of the people who are doing the training looked at my code and were blown away with my HTML and CSS and how I implemented flexbox. The trainer who is more UI/UX focused told me that my code looked better than hers. Today was a good day!

So if you are going through the beginning of the web curriculum and spending what seems like forever on HTML and CSS, and you just want to move on and get to JavaScript, keep this story in mind. The stuff that you might think is basic and “not really programming” is often overlooked by many people (and not taught to CS students), and if you are good at it, you will stand out.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

503,5345,"I haven't got a job yet, nor really started applying (I'm just in WEBPT8), but seeing all of these offers and opportunities really motivates me to continue working hard, learning all that I can, and trusting in the process that in about a year or two from now, I can have a really nice high paying job that I actually love. I'm from Southeast Kentucky, which is statistically rather poor, and the most I've ever made in a year is like 25k, so seeing these incomes, and the amounts of people actually being hired gives me such a hope that I can leave the area I'm in, as well as the income class, and make a life for myself where I'm not skipping meals because I'm worried about the rent being paid. I check this channel every single day as a reminder to keep working as hard as I have been, and in the month I've been at Lambda, I've already noticed such a HUGE change in terms of what I know, and what I can do. I just wanted to say thank you to everyone at Lambda, because so far, I know this is fast becoming the best decision of my life.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

512,5425,"Beyond excited to be accepting a full time position with TRED here in Seattle, WA! Those of you that know me know exactly how much this means to me. I used to work sales/customer support/ops for TRED, and left to do Lambda with the dream to rejoin them as a developer. I first began as a part-time intern not too long ago, then today accepted a full-time role. There’s absolutely no way I could’ve done this without the fantastic people at Lambda, from the INCREDIBLE instructors, career coaches, student success coordinators, PMs, etc etc, and of course all my amazing peers (special shout out to :bookmaps::blakey-drama-closeup:). Honestly can’t remember any really negative experiences with anyone at Lambda.

Most importantly, I want to thank Lambda for giving me a chance. When I decided I wanted to go back to school, my first choice was to attend the University of Washington; I grew up in Seattle, and was accepted to the university just a few years prior, but ended up going to a music school instead. When I reached out to enquire about going back to school, I was told that because I wasn’t going to be a fresh undergrad, they would not accept me - they wouldn’t even let me APPLY, despite having been previously accepted. I was heart broken and felt betrayed. Thankfully, UW's rejection ended up being one of the most positively impactful events of my life, as it steered me towards Lambda. Lambda took a chance on me when my own home state university wouldn’t. I think that’s a pretty good allegory for the state of traditional education vs what Lambda is doing.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

535,5645,"Seven months ago I began Lambda School with no idea what the future would hold.

Would I be able to keep up?
Would I succeed?
Would I be able to get a job?

Dealing with plenty of struggles, but far more successes I am happy to say that all of these questions were answered, and I am happy to say I have accepted an offer at Wayfair!

I did not do this alone, and I have a lot of people I want to thank for helping me make it through.

*WEB16*
<@U9SM3A64E> thank you for being my first PM and helping me get over plenty of early hurdles I had!

<@UA64XP4Q7> you were always incredibly helpful with any questions I had and I learned a ton from you, thank you so much

547,5829,"I’m excited to share that I have accepted a full-time position as a Software Engineer with StrongMind in Chandler, AZ. I was first hired as an intern back in March and am so glad they want to keep me around full-time!

I started Lambda back in September as part of the WebPT3 cohort and it has been one of the most challenging things I’ve ever done. On top of learning how to code, I’ve had to balance work, kids, my marriage, and keep myself as healthy as possible. The hardest part has been having to say no to my kids. Saying no at bedtime to cuddles, to bedtime stories, to spending five extra minutes with them. I’ve had to constantly remind myself they are a big reason why I was doing this and that this season was temporary. My husband has been a rock star through this journey. He believed in me, encouraged me, supported me and pulled double duty on much of the responsibility with the kids. I’m glad we’ll be able to tag team the kids again!

Lambda has changed my life. I had a dream of getting out of retail and customer service and Lambda helped me achieve it faster than I could have ever imagined. Not only have I learned web development, I have grown so much as a person during my time here. I have learned to speak up more, to allow myself to be vulnerable and share my insecurities (imposter syndrome, anyone?), and to have more positive self-talk (heck yes, I can do this!).

To all of the instructors and PMs I’ve had: *THANK YOU* for your hard work and hustle. You all care so much about students and it has pushed me to always do my best. And shoutout to WebPT3 (especially my LabsPT3 team)! It has been an amazing experience learning and working along side you all; you have made this experience even better than I could have imagined. I can’t wait to see you all posting on this channel!","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

548,5854,"This is incredibly late considering today was my first day and it was already announced in the hired post from last week, but I'm beyond excited to have accepted a full time, remote Software Engineer position at eSpear in State College, PA! Although Lambda mostly warns against taking a remote position for your first job, a stance I completely understand, my boss and another senior developer who both live in town have made it clear I will get any mentorship or resource I need to succeed, in person or otherwise, are onboarding me in person, and are looking into renting a co-working space to meet up at once a week, especially as we hire more developers in my area. They're a small but growing startup who write software to help detect and prevent money laundering in a town with few opportunities in tech aside from large engineering firms which I had little interest in, so I basically could not have asked for a cooler job or environment to start my technical career in without having to relocate.

With so much time in between accepting the offer and writing this, I've had a lot of time to reflect on my experience at Lambda, and everything leading up to it, and will be continuing this post in the comments section to make sure I can properly thank everyone who's helped me until this point. I don't expect anyone to really read all of it, but I want to get it all out there anyway. If you read nothing else, just know that Lambda IS worth it, you WILL get a job if you do the work and ask for help, and that everyone here is on your side every step of the way. Lastly, feel free to DM me if you're curious about salary or have any questions at all.

Before I applied to Lambda, I had known about coding bootcamps for a while, having studied Comp Sci from junior year of high school until the beginning of my sophomore year in college, where I got burned out dealing with departmental rules that prevented me from taking the classes I actually wanted while being forced to learn difficult math which I had no interest in that related less and less to the coding I was doing. I loved coding and the people in it, but I was getting depressed learning it in the context of a university, so I switched majors and schools and just forgot about it for a while as I was getting my degree. Towards the end of my college career I thought about trying again with a bootcamp, especially after seeing the life, freedom, and fulfillment it had given my friends who had successfully found their way into tech, but worried I'd burn out again if I went right after finishing going to school for five years.

So, 11 months ago, I moved from Brooklyn, New York to this somewhat small, football obsessed college town to live with my girlfriend and figure out what I wanted to actually do with my life. I had just graduated with a Music Business degree from a program that didn't really teach me anything about music business, and the only experience under my belt an unpaid editorial internship for a music magazine that ended up costing me money, hadn't made me a better writer, and left me with less desire than ever to go into any kind of journalism. I worked minimum wage ($7.25 in PA/barely a survival wage ANYWHERE in the US) for a bar that had me working at hours that started when my partner's job ended and left me coming home exhausted after running between a hot kitchen and a crowded room during the busy days, or bored to death having sat at a door for hours on end waiting for anyone to come through on the quiet ones. I quit within 3 months with barely any savings, apprenticing as an audio engineer under an incredibly helpful mentor, albeit for $10 a gig, just happy to learn a technical trade and hoping to get my foot in the door for some union work which never came no matter how many applications I sent in.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

552,5931,"On May 10th, 2018 I left work in the middle of the day and drove from Los Angeles to the Bay Area for a family emergency. That turned out to be the last day at my previous job and my life changed abruptly. Feeling a bit lost on what to do next, I spent a few months weighing my options before discovering Lambda School. I had been learning how to code on my own for a few months but I felt Lambda School would be my best shot at quickly making a career out of it. A year later, landing this job has exceeded all of my expectations.

I started last November with Web16 and it has been a roller coaster of up and downs until this point. There have been times when I felt like I was drowning in all of the things that we have to learn, or that I may not be cut out to do this. I had things happen personally that almost forced me to quit as well. But with the support of my family and fellow students I pushed through all of that to get here.

There are a few people I'd like to acknowledge who helped me along the way:

Abdul, my PM/TL for the first three months who went out of his way to encourage me to keep pushing when things got rough.

<@UD72BM1RP> <@UDPV5AXEE> <@UDDQAHVU7> <@UDNQ1PEKT> <@UD8L25VAT> <@UDLUVER6Z> - I feel lucky to have been in a group with you all during the first three months. Whether it was all the pair programming sessions or the encouragement we gave each other during standups, I couldn't imagine being in a better group.

<@UDB8EU42F> <@UD72BM1RP> <@UB28BPJA1> <@UDPV5AXEE> <@UAR8THC7L> - Working with you all is seriously the reason I got hired. The majority of the answers I gave to interview questions about working in teams were pulled directly from my experience in Labs. It was an amazing experience and I can't wait to see our entire team hired!

<@UBSNSSBK6> and <@UC2721RL0>, who made CS less painful as TLs!

<@UBSGH7RPF> - The conversation we had early in my time at Lambda guided a lot of the decisions I made.

<@UF3SV9AQJ> <@UEK21GLP3> <@UEFVA6L74> <@UEZ58TM2P> <@UFH8W0U9Y> <@UG7HS3VLM> <@UE84SL7MX> <@UFK9LRP4Z> <@UFAJM5Y0Z> - Helping you all on your journey as a PT TL forced me to become more confident in my own abilities. I can't wait to see what you all accomplish!

All of the build weeks groups I've been apart of which at this point is too long of a list to name...I learned a lot working with you all!

I'd especially like to thank <@U4KHSNE3D> and the entire Lambda staff for everything that you do. I can only imagine the enormous effort it takes to make all of this happen and I'm grateful for the opportunity I was given.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

559,6033,"Super belated since I’ve been at my job since May, but I’ve realized over the past few weeks that it’s not just about you and your journey, it’s about what gets you there and who.  <@U9639KR6F> - you were definitely my debugging buddy.  I don’t quite remember how we even started being friends, but it’s like I’ve known you for forever and I’m glad you’re back in Slack.  <@U9V4F6G7N>, you’re just straight up the best.  You’re always around to talk through things, even if it’s just hearing me complain about stuff, and you’re never shy to call me out when I’m being a coward.  XD <@U9VCU8DD0> <@U9TV0PGUU> <@U9XQL3L14> - we bonded over a weird moment and like never looked back.  Don’t know if I would have gotten through the CS portion without your humor and camaraderie!  <@U9K6M8DF1> - you were always freaking on the ball in CS10.  Like, so much so that I spent a good half of the program feeling intimidated because I felt so freaking slow compared to you.  We didn’t end up talking much during Lambda, but you were a really big inspiration to me whether you knew it or not.  <@U9KMPPGKC> <@U9ZESMAKD> - You guys are so freaking smart. And patient. Never made me feel stupid for just not understanding things.  <@U92JHA0AV> - your creativity inspired me and I can’t wait to see the kind of things you build in your career.  <@U9PH9QW77> - You were a really great Next PM, though I was a terrible Next student. <@UA9RVQCSC> - I honestly can’t state how great it was having you as a PM and as a friend.  Super excited to hear more about your new job!  I now realize I made way too many Lambda connections to list them all.  <@U79RFFQBE>, you were a really great after-hours PM.  <@U9WDY4B5Y> <@U9SQJFTE3> <@U9SJSK2HF> <@U9YJY0474> <@UB4MBM7FZ> - I miss all of you guys!  But I know all of us are going to crush it out there as engineers/devs. Some of you already are. ;) I’ve already said I wouldn’t have made it at Lambda if it wasn’t for <@U8QE15GJJ> and that remains to be the case.   I know job hunting is rough and that when you’re in it, it seems like you’re playing a game you can’t win.   But it really does only take one yes to change course. Don’t give up.

561,6052,"*CS7 Grad* (or *WEB7* as it is now), and second time posting.

It was definitely a struggle to last through 5 month of job searching when it only took me 1 month before. I kept strong and kept applying, and finally landed something substantial.

Starting Monday I will begin work as a *Full-Stack Developer* at *Fundopolis*. I will be working closely with the CFO, one of the co-creators of the original .ZIP file! Current projects include a basic HTML page and some React Native work.
This new role looks like it will finally give me the experience I have been looking for to gain stronger dev positions down the line.

Major thank you's to <@UDYBC7YGY> and <@U4KHSNE3D> during this process. They are so supportive and responded almost immediately whenever I messaged them with everything going on. And thanks to Lambda School as usual, as it has changed my life forever.

567,6107,"I’ve been wanting to post in this channel ever since I started Lambda School and it’s still unreal that I get to do that today! I’ve accepted a job a Front-End Engineer at Amazon Web Services!

10 years ago I would have never thought I’d be in the position that I’m in today. I was at a low point in my life and was damn near homeless. I was fortunate to have friends let me crash on their couches so I just couch hopped from place to place around the Bay Area. My parents were refugees from Vietnam after the war and we’ve been poor all our lives. So I feel extremely blessed to have this opportunity to take myself out of poverty and be able to support my parents and give them a happy life that they deserve.

I want to thank all of my instructors: Josh Knell, Dustin Myers, Luis Hernandez, Joshua Howland, Brady Fukumoto, Sean Chen and Beej Jorgensen for being the best instructors I’ve ever had. Thank you to Kelsey Johnson and Meaghan Barber for the awesome career coaching and bringing me companies to apply to. Thank you to WEB15 students and PM because you all made this journey really enjoyable and I’ve learned so much from all of you. Thank you to Austen and the rest of the Lambda School staff for giving us students an opportunity to change our lives for the better. And I also want to thank all of the students that came before me for going through the program and providing feedback to make our curriculum so awesome.

There are a lot of things that I want to share about my journey but it’s too much to type here. I just want to say that I’ve hit rock bottom in my life more than once and I know there are students who probably have as well. To those students just keep on pushing and stay positive and good things will come. I’ve learned the most from my failures and that’s true for my experience at Lambda School as well. My most memorable experience at Lambda School was when I failed during the first pilot program of Build Week. I was the React engineer on the team at the time and was extremely disappointed that I couldn’t build a working app for our team at the end of the week. But instead of being down about it I just revaluated everything that we did that week and what I could have done better to prevent that failure from happening again. That’s where I realized how important communication was in a team and to be on the same page from the beginning. Especially for the frontend and backend engineers. From that moment on I made sure to be on the same page with my team members from the start. So don’t feel bad if you don’t do well on a Sprint or Build Week at Lambda School. Use it as a learning experience and just keep learning and be better than you were yesterday.

Once again thank you Lambda School for the quality education that you’ve given me! Thank you for helping me with my career search! I wouldn’t have gotten this opportunity without the awesome careers team. Thank you for connecting me with a mentor who helped me prepare for my interview with Amazon! And thank you to the Wolf Pack! You know wassup!

571,6161,"Me to me: keep it brief
Also me: whatever, this is the only time I’ll post this

It took me forever to get through my undergrad. I was a bad student all around: never went to class, failed too many tests to count, ect. Turns out I love learning, I just hate studying. I started Lambda 3 days after my last final for my Psychology undergrad in August of 2018. If you’re keeping score at home, that’s 19 consecutive years of school (with a semester off here and there). NEARLY 2 DECADES OF FORMAL EDUCATION.

That’s all to say I don’t know what I would be doing without Lambda. No really, I have no idea. I quit my last serving job while still at university and said _never again_ without a plan of what to do next. Luckily I was able to join the Web14 cohort just days after finding out about the program (that’s another story).

This has been my most life-changing year to date. We’ve laughed. ~We’ve~ I’ve cried . We’ve broken a computer in the first week (it was an accident, I swear). I’ve felt so alone at times and let me tell you, if you ever feel the same way, remember that everyone else here is human as well. I know it sounds silly, but spending 9+ hours a day on the computer, potentially secluded from other people IRL, can feel like you’re going through this alone.

You’re. Not. Alone.
You’ll make it through to the end. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry (okay maybe I’m just very emotional), and you’ll meet some crazy awesome people along the way if you let yourself.

Shout-outs to people who I actually could not have done with without:
<@UB8TDBNNL> and <@UBWP48HRP> for being the best Section Leads and listening to all of my grievances/panics as a TL
<@UB28BPJA1> and <@UBPUY6Z6U> for having patience beyond your pay grades
All of my fellow Web17 TLs, you're all awesome
<@UE33MQNQZ>, <@UES3MLG4B>, <@UBZ1K81RD>, <@UEUJGSBJN> for continuing our PM group chat beyond the FE/BE curriculum - probably the only reason I have any sanity left

Oh right, I got hired!
I’ll be starting at Wayfair in November in Boston!","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

586,6285,"When I first came to the united states I was already a web developer with almost 2 years of experience but for some reason I couldn't find a job, I applied for literally over 100 positions, I was all frustrated. My family and I had to rent a house, the bills, all that stuff so I gave up looking for jobs on the field and I started working for my grandfather in lawn care, my emotions were all over the place but I was like ""I am here to support my family"". I applied for lambda the first time last year and I was yet again rejected, at that point I didn't know what to do, I started to work in tech support but still, It wasn't my thing. I decided to apply for lambda again, and here I am :smile: I was so grateful I got to study and code again. My first build week past and I was impressed by how many things I didn't know, and how I mastered everything I already knew, one day, out of the inspiring posts here in the hired channel, one said ""... Start applying early... "" I was like ""Hmmm maybe I should start applying again, I feel better know, I know it is going to be stressful and I will probably get rejected again but I have to shoot my shot"" so one month ago I started to put my portfolio together, my cover letter, started to polish my resume, and started to apply for jobs. I didn't here back from tons of applications, yet again, but the hired channel kept my strengths. I got one interview, I got one take-home channel, while waiting I couldn't even sleep lol but the next day the hiring manager called me and he extended me a verbal offer :tada: I negotiated it with a relocation bonus... 2 days ago HR reached out to me with my offer in writing with the salary I negotiated, and with the relocation bonus I asked for, and I ACCEPTED IT :tada:  I'm going to start working at THATS US Technologies on August 12th! :roo-cry: I still can't believe how good this experience was!

615,6564,"Hi, I’m Mykeal! Many of you may remember me as “The Windows Guy” or FireInjun. Before lambda I was a t-shirt screen printer for 15 years. On my best week I brought home $700. I have 6 kids and a lot of household overhead. During my time here, I’ve burned through my savings, sold most of my valuables and was forced to ignore the advice of everyone I loved and respected so that I could chase a dream promised to me by an unproven school that I wouldn’t even attend in person who’s first class hadn’t even started getting jobs. Not a SINGLE person believed in me or the school. But I did, and my wife did. Lambda School and I both took a chance on each other and saw the possibilities. Today I finished my second day at Florida Blue (Brooksource) and I mostly sat in meetings and meet and greets with the other teams. In one months time I will have made about the same as I would make in 4 months as a screen printer. This is technically my second Dev gig but my first that I was proud enough to post here.

*My Thanks List*

<@U9RB8C4LT> for helping me with pretty much everything. You’re one of my best friends, and I can’t even remember how we met, you’ve just kinda always been here.
<@U92JHA0AV> K. for keeping me sane when I’ve been on the edge.
<@U7W4PE1BQ> for introducing me to <@U7E6C1VH9>. You switching me to his group in the first week made all the difference for me. You were a great PM for seeing what I lacked and connecting me to the resources I needed to succeed.
<@U7E6C1VH9>, you were basically my mentor here at lambda. Everything I know about programming and problem solving I owe to you. Thank you for everything brother.
<@U9V4F6G7N> <@U9VCU8DD0> <@U9M2EJ9UL> <@U9YJY0474> <@U90KKDADV> and <@U9WDY4B5Y> for letting me work with you all and putting up with me and most importantly being there for me when I needed you the most. <@U9VCU8DD0> lent me a laptop when mine broke. She saved my life, it was a holiday week and I would never have gotten one from lambda on time for work the following Monday. And *EVERYONE* pulled together to help cover my students when my grandmother died and I couldn’t work at all. I can never thank you guys enough and I’ll never forget!
<@UHJ2LNRN3> for all the fun afterhours sessions. You’re a wealth of knowledge and an asset to the entire school.
All the other PM/TL’s that I worked with in WebPT2 :thankyou: there was so many of us that I can’t remember all of the names :man-bowing:

*All of the people who have helped me, I couldn’t have done it without you.*

Lastly, lambda, thank you for taking a chance when no one else would. It’s literally changed my life and I’m still in shock that it’s really happening.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

619,6609,"I made it to the jobside! :success: :starwars:

This is a little late but I still find it hard to believe so wanted to wait until my ticket was booked to post anything :sweat_smile:.

I'll be working for Xavient Digital on a long-term project with Comcast in Philadelphia at 80K/yr. The tech involved includes React/Redux Saga, .Net, Node.js, AEM, and various AWS services.

This has been the most empowering experience of my life! Lambda is the first place I've encountered that has normalized saying ""If you drop everything and pour your heart into this, I guarantee we'll support you as much as we can until we make it work."" Sometimes that's all you need to hear. Perhaps not many people in this world will ever get this kind of validation and support to do the things they love, and it's always worth reminding yourself that it's quite rare we're able to do what we're doing here. It's revolutionary! And worth the struggle.

A few bits of subjective advice for those who may find it useful on their journey:

:lambdasam: *Engage with the Lambda community.*
There are some amazing people here. Sometimes it might seem like there's noone around to help and you're on your own. You're not. Don't be afraid to talk to people and express your doubts, questions, concerns, etc. Never be rude, but always be persistent in getting the help you need. And if you can't find the person that will help, strive to BE the person that will help (but you will totally find someone :)). Great things will come from it.

:lambdasam: *Learn to appreciate your value.*
There are so many different kinds of developers out there. Even if you're not familiar with a topic, in a conversation with 3 other developers about a series of problems that noone has the answer to, there's 100% chance that if you're vocal, you'll _at least_ say something that will change someone's perspective of a problem and lead to a solution. You are SO valuable. This is the perfect platform for you to prove that to yourself. Get out of your comfort zone and don't waste the opportunity.

:lambdasam: *Set goals and keep track of your time.*
Those pieces of graph paper I'm holding in the pic are a few I ripped out of a notebook I used to keep track of the time I spent studying &amp; coding during my free-time outside of Lambda School. Safe to say I've become a little obsessed with Pomodoro (thanks <@U8QE15GJJ> :grin:), and it really paid off in the end. Being able to visually track the time I was investing and reflecting on how the hours translated into results created a constant feedback loop that kept me motivated and kept my eyes on my goals. Two goals I set for myself were to pass the Triplebyte interview and obtain the AWS Developer - Associate certificate, and I'm almost certain I'd never have managed to do either without breaking each goal down into smaller pieces and keeping a log of the hours I spent on each to keep track of my progress and stay focused.

Of course my deepest gratitude goes to <@U4KHSNE3D>, <@U7ABUEEAU>, and all of the instructors and staff working daily to make sure Lambda is ever greater. You're all brilliant and the fact that you could be doing anything you want but decided to teach and work with us here speaks volumes to your magnanimity.

<@UBZ7VJGH3>, thanks for instilling a love of algorithms in me! Those 1:1 and group TL mentor sessions were greatly appreciated and highly motivational.

<@UDYBC7YGY>, thanks for everything! You've been an amazing source of support and encouragement and it was awesome working with you!

I'd write a dozen more shout outs if I had the space. But thanks as well to everyone I've shared messages with! Everyone I've had the pleasure of being a TL for/with, all of my amazing TLs, and everyone I shared a cohort or project with - it's been real (even though I still can't believe this is actually real lol)! :heart: :forever_infinity_lemniscate_fsw14:

628,6775,"We did it everyone.

I couldn’t be more thrilled to announce that I’ve been hired as a full-stack software engineer at Honeycomb. Honeycomb is a startup working on no-code solutions for task/workflow automation. For those of you who don’t know me, I have a strong proclivity towards startups and have been actively searching for a full-stack role at a startup. A few interesting opportunities have come my way, and I feel so fortunate to have landed my dream role. I couldn’t have drawn this up any better. Right now it’s just me and our three cofounders, I’m the 1st hire, and I get to spend every day working right next to our CTO who is a phenomenal engineer. This job will allow me to learn firsthand about startups, grow and improve as an engineer, work in a bit of a generalist role so that I can do some non-engineering related things like sales and customer support, and even live right next to my family in my preferred location (Fun Fact: Our office is right across the street from Lambda’s Utah office). I love our team, I love our product, and I love our vision. We’ve got lots to do, and I’m excited to get to work!

I say we did it for a reason. It took so many people to get me to this point, and from the bottom of my heart, thank you so much to each and every one of you that’s put so much time, effort, and hard work in on my behalf. I couldn’t have done this without you. It literally makes me tear-up thinking about how amazing so many of you have been to me. I couldn’t be more grateful - thank you.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

629,6786,"Now time for some shoutouts! For some context, I started Lambda on Feb 11, 2019 as part of the Web18 cohort.

The 1st time I heard about Lambda was through - you guessed it - Austen’s Twitter. Thank you to <@U4KHSNE3D> and <@U4LAUPCTY> for starting this thing.

Thank you to Karen Zachary, our former admissions director, for admitting me into Lambda School.

Thank you to my wonderful instructors <@U8QE15GJJ>, <@UC043SA0G>, <@U6UM1TFL3>, <@UBZ7VJGH3>, <@U61C720GN>, <@U7J93733N>. You taught me everything I know. I can’t tell you how much your enthusiasm, love for students, expertise, and genuine kindness helped me throughout the program.

Thank you to <@UCU2J2H5Z>, my 1st TL, and everyone in that TL group (Weeks 1-10).

Thank you to <@UC15L57UJ>, my 2nd TL, and everyone in that TL group (Weeks 11-15).

Thank you to everyone on the Slackr Labs team - <@UCU2J2H5Z>, <@UEQG3ETFG>, <@UCM65HFUH>, <@UEX32B31R>. You made Labs a treat and I learned so much from all of you. Thank you to <@UCFBTRY1M>, <@UJVKYLMED>, and <@UF6RKC6LB> for helping to oversee our labs experience and imparting us with so much knowledge, advice, and feedback (Weeks 16-20).

Thank you to <@UDLUVER6Z>, my 3rd TL, and everyone in that TL group (Weeks 21-23).

Thank you to everyone who worked with me during build weeks. There are so many people that were a part of those, and just know that I’m so grateful to have been able to work with and learn from each of you. I loved build weeks more than anything else in Lambda because of all of you.

A few students that I had the chance to either work with extensively through build weeks or meet in-person deserve some shoutouts. Thank you to <@UFECR9TM5>, <@UE2QEQEAG>, <@UDPCE8ZL1>, <@UEX1N7QVA>, <@UD5QV9KPA>, and <@UCJA5Q875>.

So many people on Lambda Staff did so much for me. I’ve tried to reach out to you all individually, but you still deserve shoutouts. Each of you had such a significant impact on me and I can’t thank you enough for your help. Thank you to <@U9E7020TX>, <@UGHBDR6T1>, <@UJ4T14MU7>, <@UDBNNPJSV>, <@U5SF97A1Z>, <@UF538P9JL>, <@UB3TRCFC3>, <@UCD3STB46>, <@UHFCF5UKS>, <@UECD1R9PU>, <@UDYBC7YGY>, <@UKA2DB882>, and <@U7ABUEEAU>. I’m also acutely aware that there was so much work put in behind-the-scenes from Lambda staff that I’m not directly aware of. To all of you who are a part of that work, thank you and know that I acknowledge your contributions. None of this would work without you.

Inevitably I’m going to forget to @ some people that’ve had a huge impact on me, so my sincere apologies if you feel like you should be on this list but don’t see your name. If I could, I’d tag everyone in Lambda School.

If you’d like to follow the next chapter in my journey, I’ll be continuing to be active on Twitter (<https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley>).

Again, thank you so much to everyone who helped get me to this point. If there is ever anything I can do for any of you, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m looking forward to continue being a major Lambda supporter, and hopefully down the line, becoming a Lambda mentor. This was truly a team effort - and I love this team.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

632,6816,"Okay so I did a thing!! I have been hired as a full stack web developer in Tampa Fl, by In Motion Global Inc. It is a cloud base transport management software company and I couldn't be more excited. I was a part of Web 17 group and just graduated a week ago. As everyone knows that has been through the program it is not easy but luckily I had a great group of friends that formed a alliance from the very beginning and we called our self's the Den! We even have shirts!! ..lol:theden::theden::theden::theden: Without this group of guys this boot-camp would have been a whole lot more difficult and so I wanted to shout them out real quick. <@UCRR56807> <@UETHF77QU> <@UEGQXHS6P> <@UETHJGXJ4>&lt;=== [*These guys are the real MVP's.. Coding Wizards all of ya !! And I cant wait to see where you guys end up!! *] Their are some other people in this school that really go above and beyond and I would like to also like to thank them as well because 7 1/2 months is a long time to sit in front of a computer and these instructors/coach made it a over all better experience. <@U8QE15GJJ> <@UF5RJHFUJ> <@U6UM1TFL3> <@U7J93733N> &lt;==== [*These Guys/Gal Are All Stars Thank You For being Awesome! *]Now lambda is not perfect and Web 17 was the biggest cohort to be on boarded when we started but the results speak for themselves.Today I am a Lambda School graduate and a professional Full Stack Web Developer making a very decent paycheck and have a new path in life because of it.So I don't want to write a small book here just wanted to post my hired pic because I have been waiting to do this for quite some time now. And if anyone wants to see how I got through the HR firewall to get hired on to the company this is the link to how I replied to their job poster.. <https://jonasport.com/Ascend.html>  Probably not recommend for everyone to do this sort of thing but sometimes you have to just be yourself and the company will appreciate that and give you a shot! Probably going to write a blog post on all the different ways I found to reach out to company's other than just through the job application. Thanks to every one for reading this... Much love !! Peace out! Murica!!..lol","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

634,6879,"I finally get to add to the collection of amazing posts that makes up this channel. Today I accepted an offer with SingleStone in Richmond, VA. In 2015 I got out of the Marines with injuries that made it hard to walk, stand, or even lay down to go to sleep. I struggled to get a job and when I finally did, I was only making $32k while taking ibuprofen to get through the days. A close friend of mine attended Lambda's CS2 cohort reached out to me and told me about programming. I spent about a year after work every night for 2 to 3 hours learning what I could and feeling lost along the way. He then told me that I needed structure and felt Lambda was the best choice for me, so I listened and hopped in.  Today, my current offer will almost triple the amount I was making at my old job and I couldn't be more excited about it and thankful to Lambda for believing in me. There have been so many people that supported me through out this journey that without every single one of them, I wouldn't be the confident person that I am today.

Thanks to my Labs9 Cadence team. I learned so much from every one of you, the experience itself became a huge talking point during interviews and every time I would talk about it, it brought back great memories of working with you guys. <@UC809MUG1> <@UC83A7BG8> <@UERBYAP6Y> <@U9Q2F05FE> <@U9T8DGG82>. I was heavily inspired by how amazing each one of you were and could not have asked for a better team to be a part of to attempt to make the best labs project ever seen. Thanks to <@U8ZL2EUP8> <@UAKM6TSSJ> <@UEYAU0PMM> for sticking it out with me through Lambda X. We were disorganized, unruly, and eccentric in our approaches but we got through it and made a pretty awesome React Native app in the end. Lambda X gave me something to do and a chance to be in a team again so I would have been happy even if we failed (though I wasn't going to let that happen).

Thanks to <@UKW1FTYER>, we stayed up super late till about 3 or 4am one time to debug react code and it was my first ever experience stepping in to help a buddy debug some thing. Thanks to <@UA65T5XE2> for pumping me up and reminding me that I was an awesome dev even after all of my rejections. Thanks to everyone at Web14 for being awesome all the way through.

Thanks to WebPT4 for the opportunity to be a TL for your cohort. My goal from the start was to fully immerse myself into the role and dive in to help as many people as possible before, during and after hours and put myself into positions I wouldn't be comfortable in. During the first stand up meeting with my students, my hands were shaky, I was nervous and not confident at all that I could be the person you all could look to as someone that could really help you get through tough problems. I can't express how much this experience has shaped the developer I am today.

Finally, Thank you so much to all of Lambdas staff. <@UDYBC7YGY> I promise to some day come back and make a slack bot of you so that every student can get the wonderful experience of having you as their career coach. You were with me when I lost hope and you stuck with me when I felt negotiations had me against the wall, then you were there with me when we made it through together and I was able to get the offer I was looking for from a great company I really wanted to work with because of you. Thank you to <@U5SF97A1Z> I reached out to you one day when I was in a really low place and you came back and told me some of the most inspiring stuff anyone has ever said to me in my life. (I had to take a break here and step out cos I actually got teary eyed thinking about that haha). The faith you had that I could succeed when I felt that I couldn't, really helped me keep going and push through. Thanks to <@U4KHSNE3D> for giving every one of us this amazing opportunity and always doing your best to be as transparent with us as possible. I hope to some day take every thing I've learned and bring it back to support Lambda in some way.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

638,6969,"Friends!! Just got an offer for Mobile Engineer that I think I am going to accept. I can't talk about it in specifics because the company is still in stealth. But getting the chance to work with some of the smartest people I have met in my life which would have never happened had the rigor and reputation of Lambda not been so solid.

A year ago I:

 - dropped out of college
 - told my parents I would get a job without any stupid piece of paper.
- wrote this email to <@U4KHSNE3D>
Never thought of how my life would change after writing this email. To anyone reading this who needs to hear it, keep pushing and writing code everyday. Reach out to people who inspire you or opportunities you find interesting. Don't self filter. Use every resource. I flexed 4 times, was a TL twice.

Would like to thank every single member of the Lambda community and the friends I made here for life. Going to try and shoutout as many people as possible but really to the iOS team (<@UAQA3UD9C> <@U9QEDBNKH>), CS (<@U61C720GN> <@UBZ7VJGH3> <@U7J93733N>), X (<@UEC040TUH>, <@UF6RKC6LB>, <@UKW1FTYER>), the entire career team (<@UDBBPUL9M> <@UDYBC7YGY>)who have been so supportive and putting me on game (using match to get the hottest startups, how to negotiate etc).","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

639,6991,"I just accepted an offer for my first tech job. I will be a Frontend Engineer at Anchorage, a cryptocurrency custodian company in San Francisco, Ca. I’m signing up as an intern for 90 days after which I will either move to a full time position there or find another job. I’m obviously really excited about this opportunity and just want to share my background so hopefully others can get some encouragement.
  I didn’t go to college, in fact I graduated high school late (the summer _after_ my senior year). I went to tech school after working construction and have been a mechanic for around 7 years. The most money I’ve ever made was when I was managing a small independent shop and working 60+ hours a week, with bonuses I brought in 60k that year. Other than that I averaged between 35-45k a year. I went to another bootcamp in 2017 and didn’t find a job after, so I went back to being a mechanic and literally forgot everything I learned. I signed up with Lambda earlier this year and I just signed a contract to be an *intern* for 97k a year. Lambda works y’all.

Before I thank people at Lambda, there are people that won’t see this on Slack who I have to mention anyways, my wife Leeanne was a hairdresser and literally opened a new business tattooing cosmetics and applying filler just to financially support us as a family so I could go back to school. She took a huge risk and it paid off and I could not have done this without her. My kids didn’t get to see me as much but were always the best, even though they’re little, only 6, 4, and almost 2, they all respected my space when I was doing school and working as a TL in the evenings. And we all just celebrated my accepting this offer by my kids chanting, “daddy, daddy, daddy”, made it all worth it. My bible study with other families, having brothers and sisters in Christ pray for me and encourage me and pick up the slack when I couldn’t teach on certain days has been amazing.

:web18-black-red: The best cohort to ever be at Lambda

  Being in <@UCJG6S866>’s PM group was one of the best experiences I had at Lambda. Staying in touch with <@UG3CQUVM3>, <@UFJ1RR021> has been awesome. Lambda, just hire Henry already, have you guys seen what he does in Web21? They call him Duke Henry :teamhenry: for goodness sakes, it’s crazy

:buildmyapp: Being part of the best Labs group was what made this whole experience wrap up nicely. Working with <@UCJG6S866>, <@UC396M9T3>, <@UBLBR0DA5>, <@UDF16L7TJ>, <@UF42QV1QE>, <@UC59PL5U1>, you guys were the best, and getting to stick with most of y’all in CS was great and I don’t think I would have gotten through labs or CS without you.

Being a TL for Webpt8 has been awesome and I can’t wait to see what you all do and where you end up working!","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

651,7133,"Hey Lambda, I have big news! :fire::tada:

I'm really proud to say that I've accepted a job with Twitter :twitter: as a software engineer in their software engineering apprentice program. Starting on October 7th, I'll be walking into Twitter HQ in San Francisco for work every day! I was blown away by the culture and quality of the engineering team there, and saying that I'm excited is probably a drastic understatement.

A year ago today, I had no idea how to code. Although I'd briefly touched Dreamweaver in college, I wouldn't have been able to build a website to save my life. While job hunting in between positions, I started programming a bit to pass the time... I wanted to make a blog where I could post my thoughts on the job search. However, I got hooked; I started spending a lot more time programming and reading up on JavaScript than job hunting. Then I found Lambda's free pre-course, and here I am almost a year later. :muscle:

653,7155,"To WEB16, my cohort, you all know who you are. :fire: You're amazing. I wouldn't have had it any other way than going through this content with all of you.

<@U4KHSNE3D> and <@U4LAUPCTY>, thanks for founding Lambda School and for letting me through the front-door. This place is the real deal.

To <@U8QE15GJJ>, <@UC043SA0G>, <@U6UM1TFL3>, <@UH66CKXST>, <@UF6U0JF7Z>, <@U814BBRFW>, <@UKPSH0NJ2>, <@U5SF97A1Z> and the rest of the Instruction team, thank you for putting up with my constant question DMs and being amazing mentors, leaders, and friends. I don't think people realize _just how hard_ you work for students.

<@U8QE15GJJ> - Thanks for spitting truth and mentorship when I needed it most both as a student and your SL.

<@UC043SA0G> - You're a great friend and mentor. As always, thanks for your advice.

<@UH66CKXST> - Your interview prep advice worked! Also, you're one of the good ones.

<@U5SF97A1Z>, I don't think I would have led my cohorts through build week without your mentorship. Thank you!

To Alex Swartz, my original TL in WEB16, and <@UBMRKGNH4>, my Labs14 TL - You've impacted my life more than you can possibly imagine. Thanks for staying awesome and for always encouraging me.

To <@UJQ5DJ68N>, <@U921SQD7U>, <@UHVRMHEJG>, <@UECD1R9PU>, <@UD549V4AC>, <@UK7RK1MK9>, <@UEC040TUH>, <@UAH44F6EA>, and the rest of the Student Success team, and you got me through some _stuff_ as SL (even when you had 1 billion + 1 items of your own to complete). You have no idea how highly I think of every single one of you.

<@UJQ5DJ68N>, thanks for recommending me for my first SL role. I'll never forget it.

<@UHVRMHEJG>, thank you for listening to my ideas about how to improve Lambda. It means a lot.

<@UECD1R9PU>, I would not have survived my first _month_ as SL without you. Thank you.

<@UK7RK1MK9> and <@UEWMPRCBE>, thanks so much for our zoom support chats to talk about SL-ing the 18, 19, and 20 cohorts. You're both winners. :trophy:

<@UH6FW7AG0> - Your work sets students like me up for success. People loved my resume, my portfolio, and my interview answers. Everyone else, listen to her. Seriously.

To my Stampd Labs14 group <@UD8L25VAT>, <@UBMRKGNH4>, <@UD2M6PCMP>, <@UDGA031NX>, and <@UDPRDP5KN>, these last 2 months were nuts. I'm really proud of what we accomplished with less time than all the other groups. :tada:

To my TLs from both WEB19 and PT9 - You're amazing, and you constantly give to the students. Thank you for giving 110% and caring so much about the students you serve.

To my co-SL in PT9, <@UHEEXDBCL>, I don't know what I would have done if I wasn't running this cohort with you. You're an awesome person. Zuhm? :joy:

<@UF5RJHFUJ>, you've given me stellar advice ever since you took me under your wing as my career coach. You're an absolute boss and just a super cool person in general. Thank you.

<@UDBNNPJSV>, thank you for having my back when things go wrong in my cohorts.

Also, there's a few key people that have helped me keep my sanity throughout long hours of studying - In addition to _everyone_ listed up above, <@UAPF06VNG> (you could be a therapist in another life), <@UD72BM1RP> (Elmo Inc.), <@U6DDZV39D> (I still say your repos are on point),  <@UBLT30MTL> (thank you for talking with me about Lambda all those months ago), and <@UB28BPJA1> (Tippr 4 life).

665,7290,"Well, my Lambda friends, the time has come. My story is a little bit different than most Lambda students. I came from a very successful career in project management and sales where I was making more than $200k/yr and managing a team of 35+.

After about 10 years in the industry, I came to understand that I wanted to contribute more to humanity as a whole. I decided that the best way to do this would be to join a technology start up that has the chance to make a positive global impact on humanity. I applied for a few tech startups in sales roles and received multiple offers, however, by the time a company is hiring for sales positions the companies are usually fairly large, and I knew that I wanted to be involved in the very early days of a company.

One day, I was driving home and I heard <@U4KHSNE3D> on a podcast describe a school that taught software development, but where the organization's goals and the goals of the students were aligned: Get a job in the industry you were trained for. And you could do it all without accruing any student loans, and without going through a ton of useless hoops.

I decided this would be my best opportunity to learn the technical skills necessary to be a contributing member of an early stage start up, so I left my job and dived in with both feet, joining WEB14 in August of 2018.

I'm excited today to announce that I've accepted a Software Engineer position with a start up called Alpha Medical, we're building a platform to provide significantly better access to healthcare for women. I'll be the 3rd engineering hire.

Shout outs:

<@U923DEYG6> My first PM, you inspired as to what a software engineer can be. Thank you for all your help as I fumbled and stumbled my way through the early days.
<@UBWKMK59V> We literally did this entire thing together from day 1. Thank you for being an amazing teammate, I can't wait until I'm cheering you on in this channel.
<@UF0MEJPQS> This experience would have been COMPLETELY different if I hadn't met you. Thank you for your passion and unwavering determination to be yourself, it helped me so many times throughout this process, and MyHouse would never have been a thing without you. <@U9Q75AS4F> You need to hire this guy already. There is literally no one else who cares more about student life and student outcomes than him.
<@UDBBPUL9M> You took me on and worked tirelessly for me. You are a saint, truly. Thank you.
<@U9E7020TX> You are the staff member from Lambda I respect the most. You are incredibly competent, capable but you're also transparent and honest. You're just an exceptional human and Lambda is incredibly lucky to have you.
<@UCD3STB46> Thank you to you and your team for working on sourcing opportunities for me and all the other students as well. Your department is one of the things that really sets Lambda apart.
<@UF77V7NDU> Thank you for holding me accountable as my coach and for your amazing advice on my resume and portfolio.
<@UAEERGKR9> Thank you for giving so much back to the Lambda community even as your made your way through this process as a student. You inspired me to be a better developer more than you even know.

To all the WEB17 PM's, it was a joy working with all of you, great job to everyone.
To all my WEB17 students, thank you for letting me be part of your journey and for showing up and working hard every day.
To my Labs teammates: <@UF0MEJPQS>, <@UEDK5P3FH>, <@UE05W6BU1>, <@UBWKMK59V> we all know how lucky we were to get to work with each other. Thank you for letting me play my part in building an amazing application and being part of the team.
<@U8QE15GJJ> <@UC043SA0G> <@U6UM1TFL3> <@U7J93733N> <@U61C720GN> <@UBZ7VJGH3> You're all world class instructors. Thank you for the diligence and care you put into the guided demo's and helping students learn and grow through your sections of the curriculum.

<@U4KHSNE3D> &amp; support staff, thank you for all your sacrifices. You are empowering dreams and changing lives.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

668,7327,"I’m Britton from DS1. Today I signed an offer with Amazon. I’ll be working in SF as a AWS Solutions Architect, Startups. A lot of my focus will be on helping venture backed startups build the right ML/AI products, the right way (On AWS ofc!). And I’ll be working on a team of filled with former founders! I’ll also have opportunities to speak and write so I am very excited for that.

This wasn’t the role I applied for, I applied/interviewed for a different one and that recruiter referred me to this role.

But this is the role I was built to do! Build &amp; talk!

Here’s a photo of me with my offer letter. Grateful to be here at the end of the marathon. Grateful for the opportunity to gain more education, friends, and opportunity.  I hope to pave the way for others and convince everyone to give Lambda School students a fair shot…  (and I hope to keep becoming friends with more and more of you from Lambda School).

I feel like the long term success of Lambda School depends on us all doing the very best we can.
So keep killing it! Be :fire:. Make it happen. Believe.

681,7488,"I didn’t want to post in here as I don’t really like attention when it comes to being professional, I like to just keep to myself, keep my head down and work. However, I know how inspiring this channel is when you’re on the job hunt or when you’re just starting out, even halfway through the course, when the material just keeps picking up and up and you’ve felt lost several lessons ago. Whenever I got in one of those “this just ain’t for me” moods, this channel would light up with someone smiling and presenting their offer letter from all of their hard work they put in. Every time I saw that, it made me work harder and also more comfortable with the unknown. We’re all taking this crazy leap, putting our lives on hold, getting a second chance to control our future, and if there’s no one to tell you how inspiring that is, then you gotta dig down and tell yourself how proud you’re going to be when that offer comes in. You also have to dig down and be real with yourself, assess your skills and point out your strengths and weaknesses. I use to think this stuff was gibberish until I broke things down to the tiniest of pieces before I could put it all together. Just be patient and honest with yourself. Get stronger after each interview, after each lesson and constantly try to find new ways to reiterate what you’ve learned. It’s possible. I could type up all the crazy stories I went through when I “failed”, by quitting my 87k job traveling up and down the east coast at 24 years old to pursue music. Only to end up sleeping on couches, serving people wagyu steaks and pasta dishes for months, to eventually moving back into my parents house weighing 125 pounds at 5’10. I could talk about how I was a part of web13 and graduated in March only to get my first offer yesterday. The thing is all of those “failures” and “stressors” we go through, are just small challenges if you look at the bigger picture that you have planned for yourself. You took a big f****** leap of faith and if you have the courage to do that, you have the strength to get through Lambda and become something beautiful in this crazy world. :heart:","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

682,7491,"Thank you to those who came before me and being an inspiration for others and myself! You took a leap of faith and unknowingly provided me the strength when I didn’t have it to keep on pushing.

Thank you Austin and those who started Lambda, I’m sure by now you already now the impact you all have on people’s lives. I aspire to present opportunities and help others, like the team behind the scenes and yourself have done.

To all of the instructors, you all are extremely helpful and respectful people. I don’t think there’s ever been a time anyone of you have made myself or peers feel subpar after teaching the same material over and over. Your willingness to help whenever a topic didn’t make sense or a bug seemed impossible to fix has made this place such a comfortable community. The example you all have set, shows in the students that have become team leads and section leads.

Sabrina! Thanks for holding it down when I became a team lead and was stressed out with life and having to deal with things out of my control. It’s great to have people who look out for you in your corner.

Nilza! Thank you for caring! Any question or concern I had I could reach out to you and even if you didn’t have the answer you knew who did. From fixing my typos to being a shoulder to lean on when things got stressful, thank you!

Meaghan!! Thank you so much! You go above and beyond to find opportunities that match our skill set and locations. Always reaching out to see how the interviews are going and presenting new opportunities regardless of the outcome. I would have never had the chance with this company if you weren’t so relentless. You are awesome!

Edd! You’re a G man. A truly unselfish individual. You were a great section lead and was always on top of things. Thanks for the help when I was a team lead and making our lives easier.

My match team thanks for all of your hard work and presenting me with various opportunities. Many many thanks Jeff!

My labs team.. thanks for showing me what it’s like to be on a team whether I was another developer or team lead. An experience I doubt I’ll forget. Really made me believe that I can join a team at any level and accomplish something with hard work.

To all the friends and people I’ve met through Lambda y’all know who you are and what’s good!

To my loving and supportive family, thank you for your blessings and unconditional love.

Sorry if I forgot anyone, you are appreciated!

If anyone needs support, advice or just wants to shoot the shits about literally anything, hit me up!!! I want to see all of us succeed!","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

685,7561,"Thanks guys.  I'm the WEBPT10 student that got hired.

To be fair. it is a legal start up, so they hired me for my Software Engineering potential and also for legal knowledge (I'm also a lawyer).  I'm the first employee, so entering with a decent salary and a decent % of the company. I will be working closely with the CTO to accelerate my programming skills and also doing legal counsel and some other stuff (sales, ops, etc, a bit of everything as we are an early start up).

I was attending  YCombinator Start Up School as a listener and I ended up deciding to participate, because they were encouraging people to sign in, even with just an idea, even if were solo and even if you are not fully technical yet. I was watching their instructional videos anyways, so I thought why not, it will be better to have the full experience anyways. I had some ideas related to legal+tech and I signed up with them (you can even polish them as you go), you share screen calls with other founders and people with ideas, and you have to pitch your projects to them, definitely an experience I would recommend.  Then word gets around and some people got interested in me. Soon offers started coming in, I received an offer from a law firm, one from a big company and one from this start up.

 I left a law firm some time ago, working as a corporate lawyer, I was bored of it and it was not why I wanted to do with my life, the start up that contacted me was oriented to fixing a lot of the problems I was also thinking about solving related to the legal services industry (big inefficiency, which clients end up paying for, slow processes, extremely high costs for services which are easy to do, etc), so I decided to go with the start up, because I think it has great potential and the founders seemed great too. They actually applied to YC last year and got invited to pitch to them but didn't end up getting funded, but we are trying again this year :thumbsup:.  Lambda was definitely a big part of why I got the offers, a lawyer learning programming is a rare combination and pretty valuable for some this days and Lambda is a name that is getting recognized by its quality.



*My only advice* would be: *put yourselves out there*, you cant reach people that don't know about you, it sounds stupid and obvious, but it is so true and important.

So take every opportunity for learning and for making contacts.

*YCombinator's Start Up School* is a great learning tool, even if you don't found your own company.
*Twitter* is an amazing tool for making contacts and putting yourself in some great people radars.
*Linkedin* is a good  tool for showcasing your experiences and abilities.
*Facebook*
*Github* is an incredible way of showing to others what you are capable of doing.
*Blogging* is another great of way getting people interested in you and internalizing things you have learned.

So I'm going to continue being a student here. I'm no way near the level of a Software Engineer yet, and I'm having a lot of fun learning!

Lets do it guyssss :fireball::rainmoney::pizza: :rainmoney: :fireball:

More money, more pizzas

P.S: <@UH6FW7AG0> was super nice and helpful with the negotiation process, so definitely reach out to her and other career managers for help! Take advantage of all the resources that we have here at Lambda!","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

In addition, we wanted to talk about something we quietly rolled out recently. It's called Lambda School Studios.

Lambda School Studios is a dev shop built by us and reserved specifically for Lambda School students. Some employers don't have the infrastructure in place to hire junior engineers, so Studios is an experiment to see if we can help them get there. We have hired senior staff in Studios, charge employers nothing for that infrastructure, and let them hire students directly. This opens opportunities that might not otherwise be available, and is a win-win because instead of turning those employers away we can help students get paid sooner.

All of the payments from the companies go directly to the students. Right now that's a rate of $30/hr ($62,400/yr), and we're optimizing for contracts that last 4+ months. If a contract is less than that we may still do it (and you may still get paid), but it won't show up in the <#CB6GPKRPT|hired> channel. This week, 14 of the 42 offers came through Studios, and 28 of the 42 were through traditional channels.

Another feature of this project is that unlike other contract engineering opportunities, there’s no penalty to the employer for bringing folks on full-time after a contract. We don't know yet but we expect at least some will want to bring the students on full-time. So in Studios we’ll continue to work with you to make sure we’re figuring out how to line up what’s next, whether that’s being hired by the employer that contracted you or finding another. But as a way to get some paid experience (which makes getting a job much easier), put some cash in your pocket, knock out a few months of ISA, and give your job search a boost, it’s a good place to be in the meantime.

Studios is still small scale for now, but first priority for Studios goes to endorsed students who have been participating in Lambda X and searching for a job for the longest. And, of course, no students will ever be required to participate in Studios.

As always, anything we can do to help you become successful in a career we want to do. So let us know how we can help!

And again, congratulations to the recently hired!","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

696,7617,"Hello everyone, my time to post in <#CB6GPKRPT|hired> has finally come!

I've been hesitant to post for the last week because this channel swung two ways for me: some days it was motivational to see people's dreams come true…and some days, it only amplified my imposter syndrome. Endless rejection when I've worked tirelessly for 14 months felt crushing. I hope this message will be motivating for you.

Last Friday I accepted a role as Software Engineer with Back Office, in large thanks to <@U9WA4RQE4>  and <@U9J2Z047P>.

But how did I get here?

14 months ago I started Lambda with WEBPT2, having just moved to the US from Cuba, not knowing any English. I couldn't even form a full sentence during my first standup with  <@U7TL5KLCU>. He showed immense patience while I struggled, not just to learn to code, but to even understand each assignment. I knew Lambda would be the hardest challenge of my life. Everyone sacrifices to be here, but none more than PTers who spend 18 months balancing their many responsibilities.

With only 3-4 hours of sleep per day, I worked at a hotel, drove for Lyft both day and night, immersed myself in English, and studied Lambda in the evenings. I could barely pay the bills, no matter how much I drove, and never had enough sleep. Hanging over all that stress was the on-going pain of being away from my family in Cuba, not knowing when I will see them again.

One of the greatest things about Lambda is this amazing community. The friends I've made are the most valuable thing I've received here. Two of those friends were my partners during Labs. Our project was similar to Back Office's software and impressed them so much, Abdiel and Andres were quickly hired. While I wished I could join them, I couldn't relocate to Florida and their openings were not remote. Yet months later, thanks to Abdiel and Andres' praise and promotion, I was offered a fast-tracked interview process and finally, an offer to join as a remote Software Engineer.

It's not only a dream come true to accept this job, but to also continue working with my friends again. I'm forever grateful and indebted to  to <@U9WA4RQE4>  and <@U9J2Z047P>.

Today, the dream I've chased is fulfilled. This is not the end but rather the beginning of something incredible. I have received help from many wonderful people during this time and will try to thank them all, but know that if you ever helped me, I'll be forever grateful for that and only a DM away to return the favor.

Hard work always pays off. Trust the system, but also trust yourself. Make friends and network in your community. Don't do it just to get a job — befriend people because you truly care about them as a person. Opportunity will come. It's not easy but you'll prove yourself. (Wow! For someone who didn't speak English a year ago, I wrote a lot.) Best of luck to y'all!","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

711,7810,"It’s official, I’m happy to announce I’ve accepted a position as a Front-End Software Engineer with SampleServe!!!

    Cut to the end of last year late December, I was working in a factory hanging parts on a paint line, my girlfriend was super pregnant, my son could be born any day. After a rough patch it seemed like things were starting to fall into place. I had a decent job and my little family was coming together. I was doing some last minute Christmas shopping when I walked past the tech section at Target, the one with all the kids stem toys and Raspberry Pi’s. It should have been a happy time, Christmas with my family and new baby on the way. Instead, in the middle of the isle, surrounded by shoppers on their merry way, I was unsuccessfully trying to hold back the tears. I was looking at all these cool little toys and thinking how much fun it would be to share my hobby with my son, when it hit me how I could never afford any of these toys, and if I did work enough hours at the factory to afford them I would never have the time to play with him. That was it, I had to do something.

    I decided to go after a career in programming. I had some Udemy classes from before when I was learning in my freetime, I would do them on weekends or whenever I could find time. I would find meet-ups and network. I would go back to school. I would do whatever it took to freshen up my skills and find a new job. A job I loved that would let me not only afford a decent life for my son but allow me to spend time with him. After almost 2 months on this path, studying by myself wherever I could make time, I found Lambda. An online school that promised to teach you all the skills to be a developer with no cost until you got a job in the field you wanted. It sounded too good to be true. I applied and was accepted!

  I wasn’t sure how I was going to do it yet, but I had a little bit in savings and that was a start. I told my family I was quitting my job to take classes with Lambda. I don’t think anyone was sure of my decision at the time and I’m thankful for everyone that at least pretended to be supportive. I started my first classes at Lambda in February of 2019. It hasn’t been easy. I ran out of savings a lot quicker than I thought, and I’m so thankful for my family and everyone else who helped me along the way. There were plenty of times I didn’t know if I made the right decision. A few times I wanted to quit, and a few occasions where the time I had to dedicate to classes put a visible strain on my relationship.

  To everybody in a similar situation I was in, It may feel like it will never happen, and It’s not going to be easy, but don’t give up. I feel like I was extremely lucky to find a position as fast as I did, and It won’t be like that for everyone, but don’t give up. Anything worth doing is worth doing the right way. Trust the process and keep moving forward.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

714,7872,"So I’m the 2nd person to get hired from PT10 (in our first build week) and I couldn’t be more excited! I’ve accepted a position as a Jr. Developer for a company called Liftable Media.

Now I’m still a bit of an edge case so I wanted to clear that up. I joined Lambda with a little bit of Wordpress and design experience and up until last month was working for a remote startup as a design support rep. I was, unexpectedly, let go due to cutbacks and since doing Lambda School full time wasn’t an option financially, started applying to jobs. I’m incredibly grateful for the wonderful peers, coaches, and folks at Lambda who treated me (and everyone in our class) like a developer. It gave me the courage to apply for jobs that had the title “developer” in them even though I have no professional experience.

To cut to the chase, I completed a phone screen, take home test (in PHP) and then an in person interview (with the help of <@UHFCF5UKS>). All things that I didn’t think I could do before joining Lambda.

I’m glad I lost my job because it gave me the urgency to start applying for jobs even though I didn’t have everything they were looking for. I’m excited to keep learning and my advice to you all would be to keep pushing forward, keep asking questions, keep taking whatever help you can get, and treat each task as a valuable skill, because it is. I’m thankful to the folks in PT10, my TL <@U9Q99AH4N>, all the folks in my current BW, and everyone who asked questions and gave me the courage to help you out and put into practice what I *actually* know.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

717,7896,"Hello friends, :wave:
I have some exciting news to share with you all. Starting next Tuesday, I will be joining Slido as a backend developer  :slido:

Around this time last year, I was reconsidering where I was heading with my career as a chemical engineer, working at a refinery and I was not really excited to where I was headed. Then I found out about Lambda School and what seemed like a ""too good to be true"" coincidence, they were just expanding to Europe. So I left my comfy corporate job and signed up.

Nine months later and I'm standing here, about to start my new career at an amazing company, with an awesome engineering team, that is actually based in my city here in Slovakia :flag-sk:

The list of people that helped me get to this point is endless. Thank you everyone in WEBEU1 :webeu1: - all the students... <@U9HL40S9Z> :luke: my all-time TL. <@UHJ2LNRN3> :tom: an amazing SL/Instructor. <@UES6EQHRR> :eggsellent-champion: you are out of this world. <@UFAVA9BH9> :jamie-s: Lambda is lucky to have you, you are a blessing. <@UDYBC7YGY>, your help with job search/career stuff meant a world to me, thank you everyone in my build week teams, my Labs team, LabsEU2 team that I had the honor to TL ...the list could go on and on.

If there is one piece of advice I'd give you, *it's never stop learning*. This is a lifelong journey and we're all here, just at the start, taking first baby steps :baby:. You will fall, you will get rejected ...but if you won't stop, you will succeed :strong:","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

If you don’t already know my story I would love to re-share in the hopes that this gives motivation to those just starting out at Lambda or tech in general or for anyone really who could use a little boost.
This time last year I was leaving my career as a paralegal to begin my new journey into web development. I had virtually no tech background or a college degree but needed a change. Thankfully my sister, who was already a software engineer, saw my tech potential and suggested Lambda.  I completed Lambda WEB16 and immediately started TL’ing for Lambda X in the beginning of July. Within two weeks of Lambda X, I was hired as a 3-month contracted junior front-end wed developer through a recruitment company to work on-site at CVS.
Lambda had prepared me so well for a real-world development job that now only 2 months into working at CVS I have been hired as an Application Development Analyst (fancy terms for software engineer) and I cannot thank Lambda and the entire Lambda Community enough. I am excited to continue my web development journey working with one of the largest companies in the nation to be a part of bridging the gap between technology and health services.
And I would love to share some fundamental things that I have thus far learned on this journey:

- Lambda is NOT a scam and is a real educational program that gives back whatever you put into it. It isn’t always easy but if stick to it and ask for help you too can get through it. We all belong to this amazing and vast community to learn and grow together, even after graduation.
- Lambda’s program is 100% designed like the real-world Agile framework (at least in my case). Yes, I still have “Sprints”, “Daily Stand-Ups”, “Product Cycles &amp; Plannings”. I write and refine “User-Stories” and follow a Trello-like group board. You are not only learning tech work at Lambda but also how to work in the tech industry.
- Utilize as many Lambda “extras” as you can like after-hours, hack-a-tons, career mentors, Lambda X, etc. These are all offered to Lambda students at no extra cost and only help develop your technical and career skills.
- Take the career side seriously. Networking and out-reaching was essential in my hiring. If it wasn’t for a follow up LinkedIn message to my interviewer I may not be writing this post today.
- Rejection does happen and it is a part of the process, but don’t always take “no” as “never”. Two examples of this, first the dream job I applied for I was quickly rejected which lead me to broaden my search and be open to apply for jobs I didn’t initially think I wanted or was qualified for. Second, was my contracting job which I was told at one point that they were no longer hiring at this time, but after a follow up was then offered the position.

So remember to keep at it and don’t give up! Thank you again everyone a part of WEB16, Labs11, CS17,  Lambda X, and of course <@U4KHSNE3D> for making Lambda possible.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

721,7940,"A few years ago today I was a Chef at Disney World working 60 hours a week wondering if all there was to life was work and sleep. Just a year ago I accepted my first job in tech as a “software tester” and ended up working as an underpaid DevOps engineer, I thought that this would be it - I thought that was as high as I could climb as a son of first-generation immigrants. My father didn’t even own a pair of shoes until he was 20 years old. But he never gave up, and I wasn’t about to let my old man down. I saw an ad for Lambda, did a bit of research and said “What the hell” and signed up, best move I’ve made to date. Today was my first day working as a Full Stack Developer at Booz Allen Hamilton. I am happy to say that Lambda has accelerated my career and changed my life. Lambda isn’t a magic pill and your outcome is dependent on how much time you invest in learning and practicing what you’ve learned but just from talking to people coming from other boot camps I can say confidently Lambda teaches you very current technologies that are in high demand and will get you a stellar job if you can demonstrate potential. I’ve met some awesome dudes during my time at Lambda, shout out to <@UEXSR1C8L>,<@UB4FWKSTC>, and many others for their incredible insight and friendship :roo-aww:. I look forward to saying MANY success stories coming from Lambda and look forward to seeing all of you become great developers who took this wonderful path we are on. We’re all at the tippy top of the mountain, but we’re still only halfway up. Work hard, absorb knowledge, and learn from every no until you get a yes.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

724,7961,"Hey, guys! I’m super stoked to share some good news with you — I’ll be joining Twilio as a Software Engineer Apparentice in Nov! :laughing::clinking_glasses::twilio:

Thanks <@UHFCF5UKS> for posting about their hackathon back in May, which is how I first got introduced to their products. That interest fueled more and more as I followed them on social media and participated in more of their events. Soon enough, that interest converted to passion for the company. That passion naturally showed during my onsite interview and my interviewers were pleased to see it, as per the feedback I got. So, I suppose I should say I got my dream job! :yaytomato:

A big thank you to my Lambda mentor, Cole, for doing many mock interviews and preparing me well. Thank you Lambda Alumni for your referrals and support. You really are a big resource and inspiration to the rest of us. Thank you <!subteam^SFLSUHBS4|@outcomes> team for connecting me with so many amazing companies. <@UF5RJHFUJ>, thank you for all your support and really believing in me.

<@U6UM1TFL3>, you’re a rockstar instructor! You won’t believe how many times I rewatched your lectures! Twilio’s interview was all backend. I can’t thank <@UC043SA0G>, <@U9ECYGW1H>, <@UJVKYLMED>, <@U8QE15GJJ> and <@UBZ7VJGH3> enough for teaching me new things and contributing towards my professional growth. <@UAT36PJMN>, <@UCFBTRY1M> and <@UABE4CN8N> you are all my favorite TLs! You made the daily Lambda experience enjoyable and memorable. <@UFF5LGHU4>, thank you for being a wonderful teammate on all the Build Week projects and Lab :smile:. I hope to see you on this Hired channel soon.

Thanks <@U4KHSNE3D> for starting Lambda. I think you’re revolutionizing not only the broken education system, but also the broken job market! I was laid off in Sep 2017 and it took me exactly two years to get employed again, despite having many college degrees and some industry work experience! My husband and I went through tough times, both financially and emotionally. We were both unemployed for most of that first year. We almost left the bay area to move in with our parents, until my husband got an offer at the last minute!

Lastly, a big thank you to my lovely husband for always supporting me through anything and everything no matter how bad things get for you. :heart: Web18, I hope to see the rest of you here soon :web-18-green: :thumbsupparrot:.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

725,7995,"Excited to announce that I have accepted an offer with Stockwell AI! I want to make this post as helpful as possible so below I’ll add info related to my lambda journey and a bit of advice.
(Shoutouts in thread)

Start Date: August 22, 2018
Programming Exp: basically none :joy::fearful:
Degree: No
Journey: Web14 -&gt; TL Web17 -&gt; labs12 -&gt; CS18 -&gt; SL CS20 (was also a TL for a PT cohort during this time)

Job Search: Applied for a few jobs during labs but quickly realized I needed to develop my skills more after failing a few of the coding challenges I received. Decided to put off applying until after CS. Finished CS in August and immediately took the Triplebyte quiz/interview which I prepared for during CS. During this time, I also participated in the Lambda Match program. Leveraging triplebyte &amp; the match program, I was able to focus entirely on my prep which was extremely helpful!

Offer: Interviewed at Stockwell last week during my superweek and immediately fell in love with both the product and team! Received my offer last Friday and decided to accept on Sunday. I informed the other 3-4 companies I was in talks with of my plans and booked my flight to Oakland :airplane:. I didn’t really negotiate because I thought the comp was more than fair ($120,000). I also want to prove myself as an employee before asking for anything more :slightly_smiling_face:

Advice: I can post a lengthy document detailing what to study and focus on but I think the simplest advice I can give is to remain consistent. It sounds boring and dull but it’s really the only thing you need to do. In the 13 months or so that I’ve been here  I’ve dedicated myself entirely to my studies. For me that meant very few days off, early mornings, and extra time on weekends. Yes I had to make some sacrifices but I can confidently say that I’d do it again!","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

729,8036,"Hey everyone! :awesome: I *can't believe* I'm actually able to write in this channel.  :pikawow_2:
I'm happy to announce that I have accepted an offer with Northwestern Mutual as an Associate Engineer starting in January 2020. :amazed: :megaman:

My journey into tech started in December 2018; that was my first time being exposed to code. When I decided to join Lambda in March 2019, I was not expecting to be hired before completing the program or be hired at all to be honest. There has been a lot of tears, late nights and feelings of not belonging. I still struggle with imposter syndrome and still struggle with code challenges, lol. However, one thing I will say is to never be afraid to put yourself out there. This week I attended the Grace Hopper Celebration and today I walked away from the conference with a job in the industry I wanted to work in.  Always be true to who you are and know that your experience is valid, you are important and your skills are definitely needed.

Thanks to everyone who has supported, guided and encouraged me in my journey - the journey that is still underway. :slightly_smiling_face: :dancepotato:

Advice: Trust the process. Show up &amp; do the work. :strong::skin-tone-4: :computer:

Also: follow me on twitter! :banana-dance: <https://twitter.com/ItsladyKadie>","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

738,8143,"It happened. I am very happy to announce that I have accepted a job with Mable <https://meetmable.com/> as employee number 9. (I have actually been working here all week and procrastinating on my hired post because there is no way to sum up how truly grateful I am for this experience.)

I don't want to go overboard on my personal story. What I will say is that when I applied to Lambda School I was very sick. Lambda represented a lot of hope for me and my future. I am very happy to say that it has lived up to my expectation.

There are a considerable amount of people that I need to thank. Thank you <@UH66CKXST> for being an incredible instructor and mentor. Thank you <@U8QE15GJJ>, <@UC043SA0G> and <@U6UM1TFL3> for teaching me everything that I know.

WEB18, you were all wonderful. My first TL group astounded me with the little community we were able to make so quickly. <@UCJG6S866>, <@UFJ1RR021>, <@UF42QV1QE>, <@UEW9KTL2F>, <@UFGBG5M6G> and <@UHACEH7FY>. Thank you to all of my other wonderful TL's <@UCTHPCF1B>, <@UBLT30MTL> and <@UC15L57UJ>.

Thank you to the greatest TL group in the world -- mine. <@UG36WFKC1>, <@UJ0KRF4QL>, <@UJWCG5L2C>, <@UHQC3A2DV>, <@UHAA9PLHH>, <@UEUKQM97D>, and <@UBNTPLHPE>. Getting to work with you has been the absolute highlight of my Lambda Experience.

And, finally, thank you to WEB21. Getting to be a part of that journey has been the most rewarding experience in my professional career. And thank you so much for supporting the After Parties. Just because I got hired doesn't mean I am gone. I will find a way to keep them going, and always feel free to send me a message on Slack.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

It was almost like life was doing a stress test to see how much I could possibly take. I want to thank so many people for this opportunity and the opportunity to be able to do a shout out. First of all I want to thank <@U4KHSNE3D>. I do not just want to thank you for the opportunity to attend Lambda School. Having started businesses in my life and will undoubtedly start more. I want to thank you for the vision you fought very hard to make a reality. I want to thank you for the cold calls, the sales meetings, the enormous amounts of road blocks and no’s you had to get through in order to get a yes. I have a vague understanding of all the sacrifice you put into making this dream a reality. So I want to thank you sincerely. I want to thank the enrollment councilors for taking a chance with me. I want to thank all the cohorts and people I have gotten to know since March. I will always have my slack up so feel free to reach out. I want to thank my TL’s especially <@UCUHL23PA>. He has been instrumental in helping me fill in the blanks during my time here and showed unbelievable patience.I got very lucky with this place. They give you additional training and I am still making over twice what I have been making. I owe it all to Lambda and the amazing people here. Keep your head up, no matter how crazy things might be, do your best, and we will all have great careers.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

747,8324,"As is tradition, I’ll end by thanking the people I couldn’t have survived this crazy year without:

To my incredible TLs: <@UBWP48HRP>, <@UCF1QMPTR>,  <@UB28BPJA1>, &amp; <@UCZ3J91C2>; I was beyond lucky to have all of you and you’ve made me better as both a person and an engineer.

To my core teammates: <@UDCKUPZFX>, <@UE2QEQEAG>, <@UEUJGSBJN>, <@UESTUMGD7>, <@UES3MLG4B>, <@UE33MQNQZ>, &amp; <@UE0RZMS69>; You challenged me to keep learning and growing constantly, and I don’t think I could have made it through without each and every one of you.

To my labs team: <@UCFBTRY1M>, <@UCF18TTJB>, <@UE35YM5PG>, &amp; <@UEP9JR738> (special mention to <@U9GUU32CX> for joining our hackathon); You were the best team I’ve ever worked with. Thanks for the laughs, the learning, and the culture of hard work and community you helped create. Special thanks here to Gannon, you were right, and I’m glad I stuck with y’all when I was waffling about which team I should join.

Finally, but certainly not least of all, to the instructors and staff I was fortunate to work with directly in some way: <@U8QE15GJJ>, <@UC043SA0G>, <@U6UM1TFL3>, <@U7J93733N>, <@U61C720GN>, <@UBZ7VJGH3>, <@U5SF97A1Z>, &amp; <@UF77V7NDU>; thank you for making “drinking from the firehose” and learning how to learn incredibly fun and empowering. You all opened a very deep well of knowledge to me and I was all too happy to fall in, and I’m amazed what I’m capable of now that I’m working and contributing on my own.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

753,8402,"Wow - I can't believe I *finally* get to post in this channel! I'm thrilled to finally be able to announce I've accepted a full-time offer with Skiplist for a Junior Software Developer role which I will begin on Nov 1st! It has been a long road to get to this point, but I can finally say I did it!

*Backstory*: I'm in my 30's and decided to leave my comfortable corporate Commercial Real Estate/Marketing job (which I had spent over 10+ years in the Real Estate industry) to pursue a career I was passionate about in Tech. I enrolled to the full-time CS9/Web9 cohort and graduated in Sept 2018. I put together a flow chart to give you a sense of what the past 12+ months have looked like for me. I know how challenging the job search can be, but just remember, _""Rejection isn't failure. Failure is giving up. Everybody gets rejected. It's how you handle it that determines where you'll end up.""_ - Richard Castle

It is hard to imagine I wrote my first line of code ~18 months ago. I couldn't have done this without the love and support of my amazing husband, pugs :pug:, family, friends and of course some pretty great folks here at Lambda. Time for some shout-outs for the help, support and encouragement you all provided:
     • My CS9 PM Group: <@U97FEB21L>, <@U9AT0G4JJ>, <@U9JETTL3Z>, <@U9J3H3C6S>, <@U9AGDC8LU>, <@U9G3KHJTG> and PM's <@U784VJMS5>, <@U7MNLFR8A> and <@U8TTVMY2H> Instructor: <@U7J93733N>
     • My Labs Group: <@U7LJJMPHC>, <@U9AGDC8LU>, <@U9HL40S9Z> and PM <@U8EHR7D8V>
     • My Java Labs Group: <@U982V9VCZ> and <@U9BB69HMZ> and Instructor: <@UF6U0JF7Z>
     • Lambda Staff: Special thanks to <@U4KHSNE3D> for the tweet that ultimately led to this offer. Thank you to <@U4LAUPCTY> and <@UGAPTAF1S> for the countless tutor sessions and time you both invested in me as well as my career coach, <@UF5RJHFUJ> - Thank you all for believing in me!","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

757,8481,"After 6 intense months of studying UX Design, I'm excited to announce that I've accepted a role as a UX/UI Architect at VieMed in Lafayette, LA! They provide home respiratory services to people with respiratory diseases, like COPD. I'll be working on products for their internal employees, respiratory therapists, patients, and patient's caregivers. This is SUPER exciting to me because we talk about UX impacting and improving people's lives and this literally will!!

It's been a crazy ride this past year. Starting Lambda School with no previous design experience was super scary on several levels. My college degree is in Music Business, and my family's roots run deep in Cajun music (I'm a singer, but mostly rock). I was a radio personality for the last 7.5 years, as well as a restaurant account manager for Waitr for the last 3.5 years. Committing to Lambda's full time program meant quitting my full time job, which also meant making sure I had enough saved to cover bills and food for 6 - 12 months and budgeting throughout this time. There were many days of stress and frustration, nights of tears from watching my bank account drain, and weekends devoted to diving deeper to learn more about a topic.

The job hunt itself was another battle of it's own. Over the last 3 months I:
• Applied for 153 jobs
• Still haven't heard back from 81
• Got rejected without an interview for 64
• Interviewed with 8 companies (In Berlin, Nashville, Austin, Pittsburgh, Dallas, Raleigh, &amp; Lafayette)
• Got offers from 2
• Accepted 1
It was hard to not take those rejections personally, but that's just a reminder that I am not my work! (It also helped creating a ""Denied"" folder in my Inbox so that I didnt have to see a list of rejections every time I opened my email :sweat_smile:)

My advice to anyone pre-labs is to find something that caught your attention and just dive deeper into it! Learn new tools, do little design challenges, get more comfortable with talking to people; dive deeper in whatever caught your attention in class when you get some free time that night/weekend. You've already committed yourself to the program, so you owe it to yourself to make the most of it! During labs I'd have to say just remember to take things 1 day at a time. For all of my projects I was the sole UX Designer and it got super overwhelming (especially in labs) to do the research, create the flows, design the UI, and present for all the meetings. I think clearer when I just focus on one thing at a time. Time-boxing tasks helps sometimes too. Like saying ""Okay I'm going to spend the next 2 hours wireframing, then the next hour...""

I owe an infinite amount of thank-yous to a lot of people but especially to <@ULGD0FZ5L> and <@UHPJ8BF8Q> for feedback, critiques, and advice throughout labs and independent study. I learned so much from lessons with <@UCF3M8YE4>, <@UGNDCEKLL>, and <@UB8U4H8QH>. My Disney Parent build week team, Satoshi's Law Hackathon team, and Cloud Stands labs team were all incredible developers to work with and I hope to continue keeping up with your journeys as well. And of course, all of the friends I've made in UX3! I'm looking forward to seeing your hired posts next!

I'm really excited to start this new chapter and super grateful for everything I've learned and everyone I've met here at Lambda School! If you have any questions or just want to say hey my DMs are always open:i_love_you_hand_sign::skin-tone-2:","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

I wrote this to say that Lambda has changed my life since I started Web21 in May of 2018... I had no idea that I would learn as much as I have, this channel has played a major part because every day I visit it, I am very inspired... the journey continues and I just want to say thank you everyone that have shared your stories... it is very inspiring! I will continue to do more interviews for better preparation and hoping that soon I will also share my offer letter soon! blessings everyone and stay grinding, I promise this is worth it because I had not seen a code before i joined lambda and being an almost attempt hire really got me pumped up!

788,8812,"So it's taken me about a month to write this because I wanted to wait to get settled in. So I just complete my first week as a Solutions Engineer at Dealer Inspire in Naperville, IL and I could not be any more happy if I tried! So a little back story here, heads up it's a long one :sweat_smile: So I'm currently 24 going on 25. My original plan after HS was to enlist in the Marine Corps with my brother but alas meps was not on my side at the time. After that, I genuinely had no plan of what the hell I was going to do. I enrolled in 1 semester for my local college to be a fire fighter, and shortly after i found out i would have to pursue education in EMT which i was not about. I then went and did 1 semester of UofPX for Coding but didnt like the school, and then at that point I was out of ideas. I had tried and enjoyed so many facets for careers in Highschool but was riding on only one option, and I was at a loss. Some friends of mine went into trade school for Automotive whom I had grown up with and at that point it was do or die. I finished UTI with a focus in the automotive industry and for the last 4-5 years I've been mechanic in the Diesel industry. I found out about Lambda due to the aggressive marketing and like many was very skeptical. I did all the research I could, and reached out to <@U90UKAG21> via fb to ask about the school. He told about his experience and really answered what felt like a million questions. I finally took the plunge despite what others told me to, and for once did what I wanted to do. I was so excited to be admitted to the program and was loving it, but it soon ramped up quick. I was working 60-75 hours a week as a mechanic working out in the elements while doing Lambda school and was constantly falling behind. I originally was PT5, then after the redoing the flex program I was eloped to PT9. I blew up <@U4KHSNE3D> and <@UK7RK1MK9> because it came to a point where I had to chose work over school..they gave me a 6 week LOA to just get my life together. I was running on no sleep, wasnt eating and gained roughly 60lbs since starting in February. In that time frame, I came across DI on social media that was holding a open interview. Over 200 people attended and I was so desperate for ANY job that will keep me in school and was more interested in the tech field by the minute. I made it to the 2nd level interview, and then dead silent for 2 weeks. I was at a wall and depressed beyond belief, and with school around the corner and on the verge of being fired for sleeping on the job or over sleeping and being late, I was scared. I got the call when I was crying at my grandmothers table. ""Josh, we were beyond impressed with your dedication to the auto industry and the tech you have learned in so short of a time, we would love to have you join us!"". I froze, dropped my phone and almost passed out. I could not beleive it. I took a $1k salary cut and honestly I dont care. I got my foot in at a company who believes and loves their devs and staff. I completed my first week there, and it's just the start of my career with the company. I want to thank some people in helping me get here and refusing to let me give up on myself, from the bottom of my heart from a man who wasn't sure he would be around anymore, I love every one of you. <@UFG478EP2> for being my OG friend day 1 in the pre-course, <@UDDQAHVU7> for being my first PM and answering literally every question no matter the time of day, <@U92JHA0AV> For staying up countless hours to help drill JS in my brain (which I still suck at but :sweat_smile:), <@U4KHSNE3D> for creating a place where people really change eachothers lives, and I cannot stress this enough. <@UFAQLGZHC> <@UGQPEMZ9N> <@UEYMD3F0W> <@UF7G3317D> you guys have been my damn rocks. I cannot count the times I cried to you all, or wanted to quit, or just was not sure anymore what to do. You all have been best friends and I can never repay your kindness. I cannot wait to see where this new adventure ","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

789,8819,"--Alumni with Blue Origin Offer--

Hi everyone, I am happy to share that I just accepted an offer from Blue Origin. Yes! It is a space company :rocket:

*First Dev Job*
Last year, I got hired in the middle of Lambda program. I worked at Faithlife as full time developer and studied part time. I graduated Lambda in February :female-student: .

*After Graduate*
Since then, I work and ... continued applying jobs!!! :sweat_smile:  It might sound crazy that I still applied jobs when I already had a good and high-paying one.
I thought that if I ever apply somewhere else (like after 10 years), I probably still need to re-learn algorithm which I was not really good at.

*Overcome Weakness*
:headbang: So I decide to spend one hour every day after work to practice. Eventually, I came up my own strategy to approach and solve problems. I applied jobs and tested out my strategy and improved it to the point that I can walk into any code interview with confidence.

*Some Stats*
I applied about 10 jobs.
I passed 5 initial code interviews.
Interview types are various: online code quiz, codepad, phone call, etc.
I got 3 onsite full-day interviews. Each of them have 2-4 rounds are whiteboard.

*Moving forward*
I am really excited (and nervous at the same time) about this new journey. I would update with you how that goes.

801,8971,"Hi everyone, This post was due months ago lol but i've finally found some time to write today! (sorry <@UDYBC7YGY> :D)

Prior to Lambda I was working in open surface mines, and had a hobby programming so i sort of studied it for sometime. at one point i didnt really know how to take my skills to the next level, I was able to solve simple challenges in java script but none of the more complicated and one day i saw an add to attend lambda, eager to take my skills to the next level i decided to take the jump.

attending lambda was the most difficult thing I've ever done the time constraints and the expectation of learning a lot of new technologies every week brought on a lot of stress but i was determined to learn! after graduating lambda 7 excruciating months later I was relieved  but lost and so i spend many months after reading books here and there and attending next here and there and building out web services until lambda staff reached out to me and offered me a spot in their x program so i did that for a while which had set me back on the right path but i was nearing my one year anniversary of graduating and thinking to myself that the tech field is probably not for people like me. that is until <@UDBBPUL9M> landed me an interview with Plaid on July 23, 2019, four interviews and about two months later I received an offer. I couldnt believe it lol to this day i still cant believe I was offered a position to work with some of the smartest people ive ever met. (seriously theres this guy that sits like two seats from me who worked for pixar and was credited for working on toy story and such) its crazy. not to brag but i helped him with a regex issue today as well lol. flexing that lambda :muscle::skin-tone-3: anyway im two months into my job and absolutely loving it. and i owe it all to Lambda.

credit to some great people that helped me through :
<@UDYBC7YGY> - cant thank you enough for all the pep talks and just everything!

816,9132,"I was hired as an intern, but have now been hired as a full time software engineer. I’ve been with my company for 90days on the 6th which was the length of my original contract. Just got an offer for a full time role. If you didn’t see my other post (app. 90 days ago) I’ve been a frontend intern at Anchorage. I will continue to be a part of the front end team but my title will be Member of Technical Staff. I’m really excited about this and love the company I work for.

Just for the purpose of transparency and numbers for people interested: I was offered 92k originally, accepted 97k to start my internship. I was offered 115k for my full time role and didn’t negotiate. The full time role also comes with equity, 7500 units(? idk what they’re called tbh) at $1.78 currently valued at $10.13 fully vested after four years. No college degree, no prior tech work experience, one prior coding bootcamp three years ago.

So officially doubled my previous income as a mechanic which was $27/hr, now $55/hr. I was talking to my wife about what to negotiate and I said, “we don’t need anymore. You married me when I made $12/hr, we’ll be ok with 115k a year.”

Twitter dm’s are open (<https://www.twitter.com/joealfaro925>), I don’t check this slack much anymore, I can answer any other questions you might have. I’ll probably be watching this thread today so feel free to post here too. Love y’all.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

Additionally, I would encourage all students to remember that Lambda is extremely fast paced, we have new cohorts starting every 30 days. Please reflect on your time at Lambda and remember what it was like to be new, not know where to find things, and intimidated to post something or reach out for help for fear of being perceived a certain way. We have all been new. I encourage you all to embrace others in the Lambda community and lean in on our expectations around helping one another, building each other up, and being professional.

The <#CB6GPKRPT|hired> channel is a place where we post up-to-date information about students who have received and/or accepted an offer. It is also a place where we encourage our hired students, if they are comfortable to post about their Lambda journey.

For questions, resources, and information about career related topics, please join the following channels:

Not even a month into being hired as a Dev FT I've gotten another extraordinary offer in my wife's home state of Maryland and I've just signed! Hopefully we'll be moved and settled in by Christmas. 

It gets rough but just keep on pushing! Also, landing the first one is definitely the most difficult so like I've said before, don't be afraid to work and get some experience under your belt before you go chasing your dream job. It WILL help.

I'm super excited to say that a friend of mine, is currently doing a live technical assessment for Back End Developer at the same company. He's been so helpful since day 1 of Lambda and I'm so happy that I can finally give back. Make sure you guys network and try to get to know at least a few other Lambda students. 

Thank you to absolutely everyone who's helped me along the way, I couldn't have done it without you! 

Shout out to the best TL's ever <@UG3GT0GBZ> <@UFLFPT73P> and to all of the amazing and supportive friends I've made here. (You all probably don't want me tagging you so I won't, but you know who you are :grin:)

826,9303,"howdy! i'm marlene. excuse my mushiness. i will keep it short!

a year ago I had a vague idea of what I wanted and not a clue on how to get there. regardless, I made a promise to myself to put my all into it and not care about what everyone else was doing or if i was the ""best"". it's been a crazy year of ""i dont care anymore"" to ""wait i actually do care"" to ""my future is on me so i better make it count"". and i did. A frequent question i get is actually ""is it worth it?"" and tbh no. the work means nothing unless you make it worth something. there have literally been moments where i question my path and questioning to still pursue UX.

ANYWAY - 3 weeks ago I received my first ever offer for a small health-tech startup in El Segundo, CA. and yesterday I FORMALLY ACCEPTED the position of UX DESIGNER at one of my dream companies ORACLE! I'll be relocating to the Bay Area in a few weeks and my head is STILL spinning.

i cannot thank the village that got me through the ""finish"" line. The frenz i made along the way and my design manager <@ULGD0FZ5L> and many more. Especially Lambda for giving everyone an equal playing field and the opportunities this program gives you.

829,9352,"So I am posting this to inspire.  Four months ago, I received offers for two different internships. I accepted one at Perficient. This week I was offered a full-time role. I know some can be skeptical about internships, but I had a good experience.  I have worked on two projects, one Angular and typescript frontend with <http://ASP.NET|ASP.NET> backend, Entity Framework, and SQL Server Stored procedures.   The other features an <http://ASP.NET|ASP.NET> MVC  frontend and <http://ASP.Net|ASP.Net> backend SQL server stored procedures and SQL server jobs.  There are a website and vending machines associated with the second project. As well as XAML WPF WCF ""services,"" and I am probably leaving off something. Oh yeah, no git hub, we use Azure and IIS and virtual machines.
I have found bugs created by individuals with way more experience and resolved them. I have implemented and deployed to production, and people are using what i have worked on(which is cool). Keep grinding, and you will get where you desire to be. I do not have experience in any of the technologies listed above.  Yet, I implemented solutions on time. No, I have not mastered these technologies. I researched studied and learned enough to serve the purpose ""make the thing do what it should.""   Trust the process.  I will likely move forward with the next project using something called ""React,"" I am told.  I hope it's not hard.  :joy:  Happy coding. #cs12","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

842,9399,"Well, I finally get to post here. I remember first joining the Slack and feeling lightyears away from when I would get to post here, if I *ever* would, and yet here I am.

I'm starting as a Full Stack Developer at a payroll and HR SaaS company in Indianapolis in early January. Ironically, they were actually the first company I interviewed with, but I didn't hear back from them until I'd received numerous rejections from other companies that I had applied and interviewed with, so I had lost hope and was taken by surprise when they extended an offer.

And so begin the shout-outs. I'm going to do them chronologically as I could never rank them in importance:

Firstly, my Web TL group with <@UG3CQUVM3>. You guys managed to bring me out of my shell and were super amazing to me. I'll never forget our stand-ups, and your (often objectively wrong :wink: ) interesting answers to Henry's ice-breaker questions every day. Henry, you set the bar incredibly high for the rest of the TLs I had, and I honestly don't think I would have made it through the web track without your guidance. :teamhenry:

And I would be super remiss if I didn't mention my Labs group. All of you were literally the best. I learned so much from watching the <@UK2N9PLMC> / <@UG3KS23EK> dream team work miracles in our front-end, and styling with <@UHM11T0RZ> and <@UJ3P9L9CZ>. I'm sorry none of you were ever able to best me in Skribbl, even though you did really try <@UHYF2SBBL>! In all seriousness, every single one of you were an absolute pleasure to slog through Labs with, and I learned an inhuman amount from our time together.

CS, though I didn't finish it, was also a blast. <@UDVD1N0MB>’s group was awesome to work with, even though I didn't have much time with y'all.

<@UJH5VDN9E> - Thank you for the sanity-saving vent sessions on League/Slack. <@UHNGKGL75> - I miss our talks on Discord. <@UHAA9PLHH> - I have *no* idea how you managed to put up with me this whole time, but you have no idea how much our vent sessions, memes, and late-night pair programming mean to me, you've been such an incredible blessing. You're a brilliant dev and you're going to make it. :yeet_party:

Of course, I have to thank <@U4KHSNE3D> for the experience, the Admissions team for taking a chance on me, all of my instructors, and the rest of the school body for creating such an overwhelmingly positive and transformative environment in which I had the opportunity to grow and develop. Taking the plunge into Lambda School has truly been one of the greatest decisions I have made, period.

If I didn't tag you and we shared time together during Lambda, please forgive me as my head has been spinning the past couple days. I still am waiting to wake up from this dream, as I will finally be able to provide for my family making more than I ever have and actually *enjoying* what I'll be doing. Thank you for sharing your experience and time and frustration with me.

*If you are like me for the last 7-8 months and are checking the <#CB6GPKRPT|hired> channel for inspiration/tips,* I'm going to be posting my advice (based on my experience) and perhaps a bit more emotional stuff in this thread so this post doesn't run too long.

Again, thank you to everyone here. This has been a wild ride from start to finish, and though it hasn't been easy, I'd do it all again in a heartbeat.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

852,9497,"I wasn't going to post a selfie, but since <@U4KHSNE3D> asked, here I am!

This turned into an essay, so here's the TL;DR: Lambda School has been a transformative experience for me. From Summer Hackers, through Labs, and into CS, I was challenged, supported, encouraged, and surrounded by extraordinary people in the form of students, mentors, and instructors. This community is so much more than a 'glorified slack channel'. I'm incredibly grateful to have been a part of it, and hope to stay involved with Lambda however I can.

Shout outs include but are in no way limited to:

My original Web21 TL group and <@UF9EBGUNN>! You were such a great source of positivity and encouragement - and thank you for getting us to practice talking through our code on Zooms. I'd like to name everyone I worked with on build weeks this summer as well, in particular <@UJLK6060Y>, <@UJ8R7Q6LD>, <@UL36DHDB7>, <@UHUNKL760> (who appears on this post twice he's so great)

Dan Levy, <@UC043SA0G>, and <@U6UM1TFL3> were fantastic instructors in JavaScript, React and Node. However much criticism was thrown his way, I learned a lot from Dan's lectures. Dustin you helped us start considering how to structure and organize our code, thinking about state and reusable components. Luis you were so patient, answering all of our questions and making sure everyone was up to speed before moving on - we all benefited from that.

My Labs team! <@UCGHX0XR8> was our fearless leader, keeping everything organized and communicating with our stakeholder when the rest of us were shy. <@UHUNKL760>, <@UHQC3A2DV>, <@UJ6FP61JM>, and <@UGZ4URFT7>, who took on learning all sorts of new technologies including AWS, Google BigQuery, Node (after studying Java), MixPanel, Github Actions, and then how to connect this web of new things. Our designers <@UJ35JC0N5> and <@UJWN8H355> were amazing, keeping us focused on user experience, holding us to high standards, communicating beautifully, and being positive and buoyant in the face of challenges.

CS has been the most challenging part of Lambda yet, and the most fun. <@UHST4HWH5> has made all the difference by creating a wonderful TL group atmosphere where we can ask questions and work through problems together. The curriculum so far has been great, and just what I needed to prepare for interviews.

Throughout Lambda, I've also appreciated the local meetups - thanks to <@U8P7UDZPF>, <@UH7QD55TQ>, <@UGXLAV4SY>, <@UDNQ1PEKT>, and everyone else of <#C67V220FJ|utah> for organizing, showing up, helping build community. <@UA7FP5XU3> thanks for being so encouraging when I was applying to MX, and <@UHET379TP> thanks for liking my once-per-month twitter post haha.

I wouldn't be here at all without <@UK1JF25AR> and her Summer Hackers program. I am so grateful, to both her and Lambda School for the opportunity and invitation to make a dramatic career change. Two years ago I was teaching piano. This Monday I'll be a developer at a startup. In the back of my mind I think about founding my own someday, but for now I'm delighted to learn how it's done from the inside.

I'm excited and nervous to start on Monday, but the most important thing I've learned at Lambda is how to accept and enjoy new challenges. I'm sure I'll be using that skill frequently, no matter where my career takes me.","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588

856,9558,"It feels surreal that I finally get to post in this channel. It's been a long road getting to this point. Before I ever knew about Lambda I decided I wanted to get into coding because it was something I was passionate about and that it would hopefully be a job that would stay ahead of automation at least in my lifetime. I went to community college and got an associates degree in web development that was mainly focused on C#. I had the degree, but didn't really feel comfortable setting out on the job hunt. I learned a lot of programming fundamentals, but had no modern curriculum on front-end development. I decided I needed to further my education even more so I signed up, was accepted, and had a start date for ASU's computer science program. All I had to do was sign some loan documents and I'd be ready to go. This weighed heavy on me because I've been lucky enough to stay out debt and the idea of having that hang over my head seemed suffocating. That's when I started looking around at code boot camps and the one I knew off the top of my head was Dev Mountain, but it seemed to short, so I kept looking.

That leads to my first and biggest shout out, <@UBS9N6BJ6>! I found your channel on YouTube over a year ago and can say I've seen nearly all of your videos. It's thanks to you that I found Lambda. I was skeptical for a long time, but your interviews of <@UBSNSSBK6> really made Lambda stick in my mind. I also want to thank you for all of your other videos, it has motivated me not to be complacent at a company, work on a side hustle, and always be improving. my next biggest shout out goes to <@UEADRAHA4> my brother-in-law who joined Lambda before me after I mentioned it to him. Then once I saw someone I personally knew having such a good experience I joined as well. You'd always help me debug my code or explain a concept to me if I was confused, you'd always jump in a zoom to help, and I just hope you know how much I appreciate all of your help! I've learned a ton from you, and still do.

There were hard times all along the way, when I was struggling learning Redux or CS, staying up all night I'd look at the hired channel for some hope and inspiration to keep going. *It's all about repetition and not giving up and you'll end up posting in this channel as well, if I can get here anyone can!*

*-The Job-*
I started applying towards the end of CS and I was hired at Sprouts Farmers Market 12 days after I finished CS22. They're a grocery store in 22 states with over 33,000 employees. I'm a Programmer Analyst working with an Angular front-end, C# backend, and tons of SSIS packages and SSRS reports. I'm making over double what I was before Lambda, and it's the nicest work environment I've ever been in.

<@UF6U0JF7Z>! All of the instructors at Lambda have been amazing, but you've really stood out as one of my favorite instructors not only at lambda but every educational institution I've ever been at. You do a tremendous job running the Java section, and I highly recommend choosing it to anyone who's interested. :java:

869,9723,":tada: This one's for both WEB _and_ UX!  Here we go! :fingerguns:

*My background*
I'm 32 and never built a ""real career."" Finished junior college with no direction then hopped from one dead-end job to another until I ended up selling insurance and mutual funds for 6 years. It never brought me financial success but the struggles of being an entrepreneur built character, work ethic, and grit. I was being prepared for something greater.
Then, I had one of those days where I asked myself ""How the heck did I get here? It's been 10 years and I have nothing to show for it."" Something needed to change. I let my insurance and investment licenses expire, took a very low paying low commitment job, and decided I'm going to find my _ikigai_ - a profession that I'm good at, I enjoy, helps people, and pays well. I knew it was being some type of creative but I needed to be more specific.

*Enter web development*
Still at my low paying job in DTLA commuting 1.5 hours one way daily, I carved out 3 hours before work, 3 hours after work, and weekends for _*6 months straight*_ self-learning HTML, CSS, and basic JS. This is it - this is what I want to do! One day, while watching a YouTube tutorial, I came across Joshua Fuke's video about Lambda School. I enrolled in the pre-course, passed the exam, and quit my job the day I got the acceptance email. I'm going ALL IN!

*Lambda Journey*
I started and completed WEB14. I also care deeply about aesthetic and user experience so I started learning UI/UX design on my own so I can apply them to my web projects. Then, I became a TL for WEBPT4 and WEB17. Joined Labs12. TL'ed for UX7. Lastly, joined CS24 as a student.
UI/UX Designer and Frontend Engineer - I wondered, how can I be both? Turns out that's what UX Engineers do! From labs to hackathons to side projects - this was exactly my role and loved every single minute of it.

After 16 months at Lambda, I'm happy to announce that *I accepted my dream role as a UX Engineer*! :raised_hands:","  (0, 217)	0.03688555567816588
